When I tried to return to the earlier web page to correct the billing address, the site jumped to new booking page where I completed my booking, and received one text confirmation. But when I clicked on the link to check my booking, I found duplicate booking with 2 identical charges.\n\nFinding a customer service phone number on the site was impossible. I Looked throught the site and found a section \"duplicate booking\" stating \"we understnad non-refundable bookings can be tricky. If that's the case, reach out to us, and we'll wok our magic to contact the hotel \u2026 see if they can authorize a refund. Please note that the hotel has the final say on granting the refund. \"\n\nHowever, no where in the site provide a phone number. Then I found the chat service and texted with Vince, who asked for my email and the booking number, then texted me that there is nothing he can do. Vince did not \"work: his \"magic\". When I tried to initiate another chat service, the chat site blocked further chat.\n\nI contacted Mariott to explain the situation, to see if Mariott can grant the refund. Per Mariott, since I booked with 3rd party who collected my payment, Mariott has no authority to grant the refund. I believe Mariott is right.\n\nIn my previous booking experience with Priceline, Expedia, Hotel.com etc, all the booking mistakes are handled directly by these 3rd party services wtihout difficulty. The way Super operates is fraudulent in my opinion.\n\nThis my first try with Super, and will be my last."

        "Details": "This review is not only for the Hampton by Hilton Usaquen but also Super.com and Hotelbeds. I will be posting this review under their names also.\nI'm a US citizen. I travel to Colombia frequently. I recently stayed at Hampton by Hilton Usaquen Bogota. When I checked my credit card there was a $50 charge I didn't recognize. I expected additional charges because we charged meals to the room. I contacted them to ask what it was and they said it was VAT. It's a tax on Colombian citizens. My wife is Colombian but is a US resident and I showed them her green card. After arguing with them about the charge for over an hour they informed me that Hotelbeds actually charged me the VAT tax. They even sent me an invoice from Hotelbeds. I've never heard of Hotelbeds and there's no way to contact them. I booked with Super.com who apparently uses Hotelbeds as an agent. Now the whole time I'm chatting with the hotel I was also chatting with Super.com who kept insisting I contact the hotel and refused to help me. They never even mentioned Hotelbeds. Finally I got a call from Super.com and the representative had also never heard of Hotelbeds and continued to refuse a refund or help. I'm currently waiting for a super.com supervisor to contact me. But no one will take responsibility or offer a refund for an erroneous charge. I want my $50 dollars back! This review is a warning to travelers. If you use Super.com, or stay at a Hampton by Hilton you can expect to be screwed by Hotelbeds. Check your credit card, not the hotel bill or Super.com invoice because they won't show the VAT fee. Again, I have no problem with the room charge or other charges but I was taken advantage of because I'm an American with a Colombian wife. My advice is to avoid Super.com and Hampton by Hilton. I still have no idea who Hotelbeds is because you must be a business with an account with them to contact them."

        "Details": "I booked a reservation with Super, B_******* at The Restoration, with check-in on 03 Nov 2023. Due to a family emergency, I called to cancel my reservation a few days after the cancellation deadline but well before my check-in date, and was told they would grant me a one time exception if I completed their refund request form and obtained a note from the hotel agreeing to cancel the reservation at no cost. The hotel was happy to oblige and I submitted it along with their form on 10/25. As of 11/10, they have not responded to my emails or processed my refund. When I call, their feedback is they are trying to negotiate the refund with their travel partner, Expedia, but when I call Expedia, they say they are happy to process the refund, but the request has to come from Super, who will not provide any information about when or if they've contacted them. They claim to have expedited the request three separate times and always guarantee me I will hear back by the following day, but that never occurs. This site is a scam and I highly discourage customers from using it. They use other third party travel companies to make the bookings and do not have any affiliation or relationship with the hotels. They claim to not be able to call or email customers unless it's from a manager, and will not call hotels directly or accept calls from them (this was baffling to the hotel when I explained it). I will be filing a small claims case against them if they do not follow through with my refund. Customers beware!"

The team calls me at 11:34 pm EST and say they will reach out to a travel partner and see what the issue is. No one knows how long it's going to take. We are all waiting in the car in the cold.\nSomeone calls me at 11:59 pm EST and provides me with a confirmation number, saying I could use this to check in at the hotel. We check with the front desk at the hotel and they say such confirmation number does not exist. They confirm once again that no reservation exists under my name. I had added my dad's name to the reservation as well, and there was no reservation under his name either. I call back Super and there are six people in the queue in front of me. I email them and they reach out saying we will work on this. It is now 12:23 AM EST, and my dad who is pretty old and fragile is feeling sick. We decided not to waste more of our time and health (we had waited for two hours already) and leave our destiny to this sham company so we made our way to the front desk to make our own reservation to book a room for the night.

Its been a month now and we are still waiting on the refund. We've spoken to several agents with super, and several people from the hotel and nothing has been done yet. Hotel has told us they will send everything almost a month ago but super said they never received anything. We shouldn't have to go through this much trouble for a refund, and super should easily reach out to the hotel themselves. Both the hotel and super should have done everything by now and processed the refund. I will never recommend super or the hotel we almost stayed at. I don't understand why people are so ignorant and unhelpful and take their sweet time doing things when it should be simple and done with by now. Really pissed off at this situation.\nWe also feel like we are getting scammed at this point bc the hotel and super are not helping making this easy for us. We just want our refund!"

When we chatted with super.com support they were no help with getting us this info and kept telling us to find someone when we couldnt even get in the building and no one was around at all!\nAfter more than an hour, and it being past midnight, we were exhausted and had no choice but to find a different place to stay, we told super.com that we would be requesting a refund, and were told that super.com was unable to provide a refund...they told us to reach out to the hostel, and the hostel told us that since we booked through a third party (super.com) that they should be providing the refund, which makes sense! So im not sure how super.com is trying to say they can't issue a refund when this whole booking was done through them!\nI say don't provide a booking to a hotel/hostel if you are not able to provide proper info on how to access the place or provide proper support when it comes to siatuations like this.\nSTAY AWAY from super.com cause their support is pretty much usless and they will tell you the same thing over and over again as if they are reading from a script."

And it says right on their bull$#*! website that they will contact the hotel. Also states \"While we're committed to advocating on your behalf, please know that the final decision lies with their travel partners.\" also \"we'll advocate vigorously for you\". The lady at the hotel kindly cancelled my reservation and told me I should be getting a full refund from them. She wrote and email stating everything as such and I shared it with super.com \"customer service\". I haven't heard anything back from super.com. I have to keep calling and ask what's going on and they can't tell me. Last night the guy I talked to said the email was missing some things, so I got him to tell me what it needed to have and then he told me once they have that, a refund is no problem at all. I resent the email this morning with everything they requested that the hotel sent me. Again, left me hanging. So I called back again tonight\u2026 They don't have a direct number to the reimbursement/refund department. They can't transfer me either. They have no way to contact them he said. HE ACTUALLY SAID IN THE CONVERSATION THAT THEY DONT HAVE A REFUND/REIMBURSEMENT DEPARTMENT. I told him I wanted to speak to someone in charge... a manager, owner, anyone. He said they can only take information and also kept saying he doesn't understand that one. I asked him if this was a fake company. He said it wasn't. I said I don't believe that one bit. I told him I wanted this dealt with because they are doing everything in their power to feed me bull$#*! and I'm tired of it. This company is a joke. Look around for reviews. You will see.

Moreover, when I talked to chat agent multiple times, they were not supportive at all.\nEither Supers policy should clearly state that any change is not refundable, even if hotel says OK or Super should return the fund that customer is eligible, especially when Hotels are getting paid for the duration of stay and not the duration of booking.\n\nI will never ever recommend such unethical platform, especially when the price comparison is not much and other available platform are more established and ethical.\n\nTo add to that they are providing coupons which are also tricky. You have utilize that within 2/3 weeks and who do you think will book another hotel within next 2/3 weeks. It is almost a prank played to the customer."

He said I should doublecheck my date is correct so I did with him watching. It was not correct so I changed it to the 12th with him watching me do it and after hitting the button to close the deal, the confirmation arrived and the date has reverted back to the incorrect date and hotel suggested I contact customer service chat to have them edit it to correct date. I did and they refused to correct it, even after I informed them that I would be normally be willing to book an additional room tonight and keep the incorrect booking for next week but I would not be in town for that date and couldn't possibly stay at this hotel on the date THEY changed my booking back to. Despite having the hotel desk clerk as an eye witness to my correct booking info, they refused to do anything at all. I informed them that I would contact my bank and dispute the charge on the incorrect booking and never use Super.com ever again and their response was \"ok thanks for reaching out to us. Hope we helped you resolve your issue.\" The hotel employee said I was victim number three of this bait and switch tactic. Good luck with using this site. For a couple dollars more I got the room from another booking site and next week an empty room with my name on it will go to waste unless my bank refuses to pay out on their trickery. Saving two extra dollars on the rate cost me $75 loss. Nothing you can do other than dispute it with your own bank I guess. Not sure why they call that chat department \"customer service\" because they provided zero service. Done."

The young lady at the check in was amazing super helpful. So here I am 5 hours later, no call from the Urgent Care team, I am trying to chat with them and I have been waiting on an agent in the chat function for 20 mins at this point. Overall a HORRIBLE experience with these clowns. If you have last minute booking don't even think of using super.com. Seemed like a cool process and a way to save some money. Nope bad news.

When I spoke with the hotel they said that I actually had a bottom floor room and needed to contact super to change the room. When I did they said I couldn't and needed to cancel my booking and re-book. So I tried that and had them reimburse me through their points so I could use the money right away to re-book instead of waiting 3-5 days for reimbursement. This is where things started getting bad. I was told I could only use that money on their App, after downloading the App it sends a code to your phone before you can sign in. The code never sent. I contacted support and they told me to keep trying and/or redownload the App. I did this about 20 times before I gave up. Then I reached out to get a refund in full. They told me it would be 3-5 days and not to worry. I waited a little over a week and still no refund. So I reached out again and they said sorry it didn't process and now it would be 2-3 days. After 5 days I still didn't see my refund. So I processed a claim with PayPal. Well PayPal has also been no help at all and will not push the claim in my favor without an email from them about the refund. I asked them for this email and was told they don't do things that way. Then I asked again about the refund. First I was told that they have to reach out to the hotel which could take a while, and now I have been told they can say nothing to me because I made a claim so my account was shut off.

They only said I'm sorry but literally they are getting money out of you laying to the tourist. I only stayed there one night the first one. The next day I could not stay there. It looks like I was in a place after World War II Awful. Do yourself a favor and pay a bit more an go to s trusted site. You will have a peace of mind and don't give your money away. If I new the hotel will look like that I would never book it with them. Shame on them and yes I'm pissed because even thought I only stayed one night they pocket the other 3 night of my money.

I've never had an overbook or stay issue. ** However, their customer service is not very good at all. You may wait a couple of hours to reach someone. When you do, you can tell they are in another country. But they don't seem to have any knowledge in resolving problems. They just give repeated statements with no research effort. One problem I had since they changed from Snaptravel to Supertravel is the earned $$ you accumulate from your stays. It's connected to your phone #. They now mandate you download their app in order to use those funds you've earned. The app never sends out 4-digit text message to confirm my phone number. Customer Service says it's my phone. The Geek squad at Best Buy went through my phone and other messages and says it is Super.com's app communication that is having the problem. The website can confirm the number and sends me texts all the time (same company). Almost seems like they are trying to keep me (customer) from using my earned $$. It worked fine on the mobile website. Customer Service manager says \"no, you have to use a different phone number.\" I asked why? She said because your phone doesn't work. Sound fishy? The earned $$ is tied to the number that I've been using. If enough people make noise about it they will have to do something.\n\nAgain, discounted lodging = the best. Customer service and web support = the bottom."

My husband was the one staying there, he noticed some chipring and there were crickets/bugs in my husband's hotel bathroom drain, due to his limited mobility he had a handicap accessible room. The hotel tried to move him but due to the unavailable of more handicap accessible rooms or first floor rooms he couldn't move up any flight of stairs. We told the hotel about this and they said they couldn't return our money because we booked through a 3rd party OTA(online travel agency) and to call them. I called them and they gave me the run around. Now I'm out almost $600.3 stays 1) 8/19-8/22 paid $184.96 2) 8/22-8/25 paid $ 184.95,3) 8/25-8/28 paid $195.93. When I contacted super.com through their chat app, they were very towards me, and told me I had to get my money back from the hotel, the hotel said they can't refund me because I didn't purchase through them, when I told super.com about it they brushed me off and told me that they can't refund me, I paid almost $600 for a hotel room that was disgusting and full of bugs. Not to mention the person whom helped me through chat was very rude and kayak should be ashamed of promoting them, been fighting for my money back for over a month. The hotel I booked through them was the only hotel available in the area so had no choice to use them."

After I FINALLY was able to talk to a supervisor (after 4 hours of waiting for the call back) they told me I had to reach out to the hotel & get names and confirmation that they can refund me the $83. When I attempted this, it is by law & policy that the third party has to call and speak to the hotel directly not through me or email. They refused to call & proceeded to get snippy towards me because I offered to 3 way the hotel so they can sort it out. They literally used EVERY excuse you imagine throughout this whole ordeal. They refused to connect me through to a supervisor stating that they have to put a ticket in & they will give me a call back \"shortly\".\nI NEVER have issues with any third party & I definitely don't ever feel the need to yell at a rep that has no control over the situation BUT A I WILL NOT be disrespected, let alone over their own website error & refunding my money...

As of Today, September 13, the Hotel STILL has no record. I have called, e-mailed, and requested to speak with a Supervisor or Manager repeatedly. None is ever able to get on the phone, and I was told I would receive a call back within 24-48 hours. I HAVE RECEIVED NO CALL BACKS. I have also received e-mails back from different individuals stating \"I am working to resolve your issue\" with no further communication despite my responding repeatedly to these e-mails, there is just NOBODY there to resolve. Super.com web site actually says that sometimes the booking at the hotel is not available until day of check in...HUH? Are we that stupid we would wait on a reservation until check in only to find out it is a SCAM? I have called the hotel repeatedly and they informed me that this particular company, Super.com is known for booking without forwarding the reservation to the Hotel. Remember, If the rate is too good to be true, DONT BELIEVE IT. DONOT USE SUPER.COM. Needless to say, I cancelled the reservation while still refundable according to booking, but am still waiting for it to be credited to my credit card account."

Since I didn't have a problem, I can't say how trying to contact the OTA would have went. One thing I will say to watch for, the deal may look good but they do add fees that other OTAs don't.

        "Details": "I booked a hotel with Super.com over Labor Day weekend. With a hurricane hitting Florida, my wife and I canceled our trip. All other hotels we booked that week canceled with no problems. For this hotel with Super.com, I used the link on my confirmation email to cancel within the allotted timeframe. There was not an option to cancel. I tried calling but was on hold for about an hour before giving up. I then spent hours of my Labor Day Weekend on hold with their \"customer service\" department, was disconnected multiple times (seemingly on purpose), and was finally told they need to check with their travel partners, which could take 30 days. When calling the hotel, they said they would cancel no problem, but because I booked with a third party (Super.com), they cannot do so and I must cancel through Super.com. So I know Super.com was not checking with any \"travel partners.\" Instead, they were giving me the run around so they could just tell me canceling with a refund is not possible. Sure enough, a couple days later, they told me they could not issue a refund. This company shows absolutely no care for their customers. They way they treat their customers is downright disrespectful. I have never been treated by any company so poorly. Never ever book through super.com. I have learned my lesson the hard way and will be sure to never use their services ever again. Do not make the same mistake I did."

My wife recently had some major GI surgery so we needed a kitchen, and we had dogs, so not the easiest problem to solve all at once.The entire process, beginning to end was enfuriating. For beginners, when you check their prices, there's a timer that starts, so if you don't reserve your room in time, the price goes up. So I had to use their link to send a code to my wife to give her 10% of the same room, which brought it to an amount higher than the original price displayed to me. But it was still cheaper than others, so i played their stupid game. I arrived at the room with my dogs who had been stuck in the car for 4 hours, along with a wife who was about to burst thanks to that GI surgery, and there was no reservation under my name. I called and learned that super.com doesn't reserve rooms with the hotel, the are a 4th party booker. They steal deals from other 3rd party bookers. So they never even talk to the hotel. They talk to other companies that talk to the hotel. So when I called to complain, they sent me to their \"emergency guest services\" which took 20 minutes to call me to tell me that they needed 20 minutes to call the other company then call me back. We're at 40 minutes with a bout to explode wife. Then they passed my complaint to the other company. They called back and told me the other company never recieved a confirmation from the hotel so they never actually booked it. Funny, my credit card was still charged. So they apologized and told me they could ask the other company to book me a new room. I asked if the room would have the same amenities. They said the only amenities they could guarantee was free breakfast and 2 queens. I asked about pets and kitchen and was told they couldn't guarantee those, and that it would take about an hour to find us a room. I just told them I'd take my money back and figure it out. I reserved a room without a kitchen because the hotel that I canceled with was no longer affordable at the current rate. An hour later I got a text from super saying they had an awesome deal at the exact room i originally booked at close to the original rate. Why they couldn't give me that information while I was sitting outside the hotel wishing I could be in it, I don't know. Wait, yes I do. They're a 4th party company. They are the sketchy friend, selling stuff from their friends cnsignment shop and trying to get a cut. I've already paid my pet fee, dealt with the BS, and now they're just throwing salt in the wound. Thanks. I'm done.\n\nIf you can avoid booking with them, it'd potentially save you a whole lot of frustration. I know I wish I never had."

Apparently during the approval process before final purchase your given a notification saying no modifications or refunds for this purchase. I suggest searching with a gigantic magnifying glass to find this so called notification because I did not see it anywhere. Long story short we were out 200 bucks, customer service was $#*!. Just to note this was for a hotel in America and we live in Canada so no way were we able to even stay in the hotel for the dates we \"accidentally\" booked. I highly recommend staying far away from super.com unless you want to be spoken too rudely, taken advantage of and out money! RIP OFF SITE"

I had 2 rooms reserved far in advance with super.com and reserving.com (with the purchased insurance mind you, both terrible agencies in refunding you your money). If you read the Diez Hotel website they claim both just a valid photo ID and easy cancellation if you run into any issues (see the screenshot for verification or the hotel's FAQs section).\n\nDay 1 - We arrive at Medellin and it is raining. Immediately we try to check in to our already paid-for rooms with passport and/or government-issued IDs. However, the hotel denied our party the ability to check in because there is an \"unwritten rule\" that government IDs must be Colombian despite this not being a written policy anywhere nor a warning upon reservation. The hotel did not attempt to remediate the issue or be helpful whatsoever despite already being paid $800 for 2 rooms. Fortunately, other hotels nearby do not play these games and were more than welcoming to provide us rooms (tyvm Jo and Joe Hotel, they were half the price and super accommodating having no said policy to accept paying guests).\n\nFor the entirety of the vacation, I spent the week trying to get my $800 reimbursed by the hotel and reservation agencies because no service or rooms were provided. However, surprise surprise no one wants to return the money (even after purchasing the insurance with the reservation company!) and I am working ways to recoup my expenses having already paid half of that for 2 rooms with Jo and Joe Hotel, which again, were more than amazing and cheaper.\n\nStay away from Diez Hotel and this reservation company if you want to avoid a nightmare and not get robbed out of hundreds of dollars."

I contacted SuperTravel and a customer service rep told me my funds would be reissued in 2-3 business days. That did not occur. I called them back multiple times and finally got them to escalate the call to a manager, Mark Louie. He called me back and the phone rang 3 times and disconnected - I did not have time to catch the call before he hung up. He then responded via email (despite my request for a phone call) stating the reservation was non refundable and I needed a letter with signatures from the hotel owner and others stating they could refund me. I responded via email that they need to check my call where the customer service rep said I would be refunded. I emailed them 2-3 times with no response. I called back multiple times and Mark Louie called me back, only repeating it was non refundable and then the phone disconnected mid conversation. I tried calling back repeatedly but never heard from him again. I finally got the information of a new Supervisor, Annie, who was sympathetic to my situation and agreed they should honor what I was told originally and that she would negotiate a deal. I then received an Email from her stating I would not be refunded without that letter. My father passed away a month after the fire and I do not have time to jump through hoops, especially after I was told by the company I would receive my refund. A legitimate, reputable company would stay true to their word and not fight someone in their time of need. They are not a honorable and trustworthy business and I can only feel as though I've been scammed. And if you have to contact them after your reservation has been made, good luck getting through to them, especially if you need to speak to a manager. Beware doing business with SuperTravel"

Usually when we book room that covers all that. Also, if these charges are mandatory then they should be part of the price so customers wouldn't mislead about the price. Hotel receptionist told me that experience charges are mandatory, so it should be added in total price. If we know that to pay $200 extra for experience charges then I must not book the hotel. What we are paying for then? Only the bed in the room? This is totally unfair and I am so upset with that. This is why they show less price and later charged via hotel. super.com are not positive with this complaint. It is responsibility of the super.com to contact the hole and manage the refund.

        "Details": "We booked a two-night hotel stay via Super.com, and paid directly to the website. We paid extra to have a room with two queen beds. When we arrived to the hotel, we found out that Super.com had sent them a reservation for the cheapest room they had, a room that only had one bed in it. In Super.com they had both room types listed. The one we booked and paid for was $110 per night, which we paid. The 1 bed room would have been cheaper. They listed it as $84 per night.\nWe called Super.com right away, expecting them to fix it so that we get the room we reserved and paid for. Little did we know. Their customer service calling center is probably in the Philippines - it was really hard to understand what they were saying. Instead of professionally checking the booking and getting us the room we had paid for, they totally gave us the runaround, asking us to email them paperwork from the hotel, they lied to us several times during the many calls and said someone will call us back - nobody ever called. They also lied and said they had sent us an email regarding the refund - but we received no emails either. There are no supervisors available at the calling center, and the reps on the phone don't have any idea what they are doing. They also have no authority to fix anything. All they do is they keep apologizing and apologizing and nothing gets fixed, and lying that someone is working on it and will call us and never do.\nWe kept trying to get the room we paid for for the two days we stayed in the hotel, but couldn't. We had no choice but to stay in the tiny room with just one bed - and with two adults, it was not comfortable. The hotel was really nice and they said Super.com has done this same to many customers, and every time they just give the guests the runaround and nothing happens.\nThey have promised to call us numerous times. Nobody has ever called. They said they had emailed us information, but that was a lie as well. No emails were received from them. Its now 3 days after we left that hotel, and I am STILL trying to get a refund for the difference between the room we booked and paid for, and the tiny room with one bed that Super.com reserved for us. The hotel says every time this happens, they send them the cheapest reservation and keep the difference between the higher room rate and the one they actually reserve.\nFinally, yesterday we received a text from Super.com. The text said they are giving us a $30 credit we can use towards any reservation we make using Super.com! They owe me $86.67. That's the difference between the room we paid for, and the room they reserved us - and they offer a $30 credit that can only be used if we continue to use Super.com for our bookings! And a supervisor STILL hasn't called me, or emailed me. Not only they ruined our mini vacation by making our stay really uncomfortable, but they are stealing my money, the money I paid for the bigger, comfortable room we wanted. This is unbelievable. Do not let this happen to you. Use Hotels.com, Expedia, or any other service. It is not worth it to let them ruin your vacation. When something goes wrong, they do absolutely nothing to fix it, so don't bother."

However, upon arrival at the hotel, I was blindsided by an additional $123 resort fee. To make matters worse, the condition of the place was far from what was expected; it was in a deplorable state internally. Shockingly, this hefty fee was sneakily tucked away in fine print on SUPER.COM's website, with no transparent mention during the booking process. To verify this, I compared their process with Expedia's, which explicitly informed customers of any additional resort fees, even collecting them upfront. It's evident that SUPER.COM's practices are misleading at best and deceptive at worst. Potential users, beware!"

The hotel agreed to this and sent Super an email stating they approved a refund for us. We heard nothing from Super for weeks. We called them to check the status of this, and they claimed they sent us an email that they denied our refund, even though the hotel approved a refund. They would not give us a legitimate reason, they said their \"travel partners\" reviewed our case and denied a refund. The representatives we talked to were incredibly unhelpful and just kept repeating that \"their travel partners denied our refund\" and wouldn't even tell us who these \"travel partners\" are.

After every booking I did I received coupon cash $$ to go towards my next booking which over the month of August was a lot. I am a bargain shopper so I check multiple sites and price each hotel on each site to see which is the cheapest. Each and every time it was always super.com that turned out to be the cheapest plus I could apply my coupon cash as well so then the price would drop even more. There are other things that super.com offers as well. If you decide to use them you will not be disappointed! I used them multiple times in August 2023 that I ended up saving hundreds of dollars and that is not even an exaggeration. Once again you will not be disappointed you have my word. SUPER.COM IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Thank you Super"

Saturday afternoon we got our daughter ready to go swimming, the whole reason we got the room in the first place just to find out from rude staff that nobody can swim because it's not safe. Then on Sunday afternoon when returning from lunch we seen people swimming. I asked the manager who was there and he said the pool is safe. I said that was pretty quick so in less than 12 hours it's now safe. I was not a happy dad. So as I stated, Super.com was awesome the Radisson staff and policy's suck."

Showed up to the hotel at 1:30am after a long day of travel, and the front desk stated they could not locate my booking. Called SuperTravel customer service. Left on hold for quite some time and then finally patched through to a representative. Said they will escalate to \"Urgent Care team\" and that they will call back in 20mins. Fast forward an hour and 30mins, it's now around 3:30am and finally get a response. The company states they could not get a hold of the front desk. This is a blatant lie as I was next to the front desk the entire time and not once did they call. They are not able to resolve the issue and offer to cancel my stay. I'm forced to rebook at a different hotel as the one I originally booked is sold out (at a much higher price). I emailed my original hotels customer service to investigate and it turns out SuperTravel had cancel the reservation 40mins after I had booked. Completely fraudulent. Please, please avoid this company. Extremely unethical. And if they had canceled my reservation after 40mins of me booking, the least the company could have done is informed me.

When we arrived they could not find a reservation. This was NOT the hotels fault at all. I really do want to stay here next time and will book directly for sure! Do not and I repeat. Do not use super.com! When you reserve the hotel that you want, super.com is actually putting you in a different hotel across town! There was another family there that they did the exact same thing to. The hotel and myself were on the phone with them for 2 hours before we figured out that the information on their website is messed up and they're putting people in a hotel across the city. I called the other hotel and asked if I had a reservation there and they said yes. I had never even heard of this hotel, Guess what? We stay there for two nights... I was on the phone with super.com representatives for another hour. I tried to explain to them, as did the hotel, that they are putting people in the wrong hotel that they are not booking! They could not understand what I was saying! I basically told them, I booked this hotel that I wanted but you put me in a totally different building across town and I want to file a complaint. After being left on hold several times, she basically said, \" Our information says you are now in a Holiday inn Express and there's nothing we can do\". Lesson learned. I will use booking.com for now on!"

I tell them and they basically said we'll sorry your just out over 200 bucks! I'm a single mother of two kids I struggle enough and simply was trying to treat my kids some time away and to do What they do best splash around in the pool. Instead we got robbed of our money I've called back everyday in hopes they would stick to their word on getting confirmation that the hotel canceled and refunded on their end told me to send it to there email I did and still nothing no sorry no money back no making other room choices nothing they did absolutely NOTHING TO HELP ME. Also when I was on the phone with them they had people screaming in the background so loud I could barely hear or understand what was even being said I informed them it was to loud and that's not very professional and they told me to not worry about it they was employees that was around them at the time. Like... ummm what? Point is do not go through them like I made the mistake in doing I can almost garentee you will get robbed and told basically just deal with it. I will never deal with these people ever again and definitely learned my lesson sad they have to do people like that. Karma is real yall what goes around comes around! Ps- be good to people yall!"

According to their communication, the refund was processed and should have been returned to the original payment card within 1-5 business days.\n\nHowever, five business days passed, and I did not receive the refund. Since then, I have made numerous phone calls and sent multiple emails, encountering unresponsive and repetitive responses from their agents. They simply state that the refund has been processed and advise me to contact my bank. I explained that my bank confirmed having no record of the refund, and I even offered to share my credit card statement as proof.\n\nTheir agents lack transparency and seem defensive, with one of them attempting to misinform me about the processing time, contrary to their own stated terms and conditions. As of today, I have still not received the refund, which amounts to nearly $1000.00. This experience has left a negative impression, and I will not consider using their services in the future."

The hotel referred me back to Super to get receipts. I contacted Super who gave me basic receipts which showed nothing of value other then the cost at booking. I asked for itemized receipts to which they said they couldn't provide. I mean what kind of legitimate business can't or won't provide detailed receipts? All they would provide was the original booking receipt. I expressed frustration in a very, very professional and courteous way. They then stopped all communication and I'm stuck not being able to get help from the hotel OR Super. I will not use this site again and will discourage others from doing so. By the looks of things, I'm not the only unhappy FORMER customer or theirs. DO NOT USE THIS SITE because if you have any issues with the booking, you will not get assistance."

Super refused to help and claimed they are just a booking service and will not issue discounts for hotel malfunction, whether there is a sanitary emergency or not. We talked to the hotel manager, who was equally frustrated with them. She said multiple 3rd party booking companies had called her to verify and proceeded to issue refunds to their customers. Super still refused to provide assistance. The hotel was kind enough to step in and provide the customer service that Super refused. We signed up for wyndom rewards and they issued us enough points for 2 free hotel stays in the future. Super is AWFUL"

I have photos of what it showed. I got someone in the Philippines named Leona, she said I will need to charge you a cancelation fee. I said why would you charge me anything, you should just fix my reservation to what I booked. She said I am on the site and there is no issues and we have had no other complaints, like I am lying. I wish you could see the website pictures and you would know I am telling the truth. I asked for a supervisor and she said they were just going to tell me the exact same thing as she was telling me and they would not fix it, because I booked the wrong room. I got a call back from an agent who lied and said he was a supervisor. I was trying to tell him what happened and he cut me off and said I was talking too much. I asked for his name and refused to give it to me and hung the phone up in my ear. They have all this staff in the Philippine's working from home and the service is horrible. I booked the room their site showed me as two beds. I booked this for 3 men, and it says 3. Why would I ever book one queen bed for 3 grown big men? Do not ever use these people. They are dishonest and will not fix their issues and work to make things right. The site said total for 2 beds was 110.00 per night and with taxes and fees a total of $134.91. Beware they will not help you and they threaten you. I have noticed more and more that customer service employees in the Philippines are getting smart with US citizens and are not trying to help them resolve issues. Customer Service is horrible and only threatened me with fees and blamed me for messing up, when its their system that messed up. Stay clear of Super Travel. They are very very unethical and will not help you. Please see my photos showing what was presented on the site when I booked the reservation. Their site was wrong and listed two beds for the standard room and they would not fix the issue."
