However, booking went smoothly and I secured the best price around when I booked by a lot! Emails and WhatsApp messages were really informative and helpful, and checking in at the Hilton was easy. Plus, I shared my discount code for booking with a friend who also used their site and likewise had a similar smooth experience. Definitely would book via super.com again"

I have already mentioned it to several friends to use as well. Best google find EVER!"

I hope it can be this good to always I don't usually write reviews. Only when something is bad, but just wanted to do a positive one for a change. Thank you Super Save. Oh though I chose a cheaper option for the room with 2 beds,the hotel was nice enough to upgrade me to a king at no extra charge. It was nice and much appreciated"

Great food BTW.\nWill definitely use this site again!"

        "Details": "For saving money, they are perhaps the best travel website and I've used dozens of various travel sites. I travel weekly. I've never had an overbook or stay issue. ** However, their customer service is not very good at all. You may wait a couple of hours to reach someone. When you do, you can tell they are in another country. But they don't seem to have any knowledge in resolving problems. They just give repeated statements with no research effort. One problem I had since they changed from Snaptravel to Supertravel is the earned $$ you accumulate from your stays. It's connected to your phone #. They now mandate you download their app in order to use those funds you've earned. The app never sends out 4-digit text message to confirm my phone number. Customer Service says it's my phone. The Geek squad at Best Buy went through my phone and other messages and says it is Super.com's app communication that is having the problem. The website can confirm the number and sends me texts all the time (same company). Almost seems like they are trying to keep me (customer) from using my earned $$. It worked fine on the mobile website. Customer Service manager says \"no, you have to use a different phone number.\" I asked why? She said because your phone doesn't work. Sound fishy? The earned $$ is tied to the number that I've been using. If enough people make noise about it they will have to do something.\n\nAgain, discounted lodging = the best. Customer service and web support = the bottom."
