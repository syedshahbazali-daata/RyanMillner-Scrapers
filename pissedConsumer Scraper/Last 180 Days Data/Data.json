        "Details": "I reserved a room for Nov 25 and 26 at the Best Western in Patterson Ca. through Super.com. When I arrived with my family to check in (to which I was successful, the clerk handed me the room key and as I was walking away she flagged me down. She told me that reservation was for the following weekend. I called Super.com (on the advice of Best Western) and asked them to modify the date to the current day. I did. It took one hour for Super.com to respond and Super.com suggested to Best Western that I cancel my reservation and that I be refunded within 14 days. So I waited. When the time came closer to the original reservation date (Dec 2nd and 3rd) I recieved a a text message saying that everything was ready for me to check in on that date. So I called Super.com AGAIN and I explained everything and asked if the reservation was still valid because I had not recieved my refund but I recieved a text message saying that my stay was ready. I was told by the operator that my reservation was still valid and that I was to check in on Sat. Dec. 2nd... and assured me there would be no issue. So again I went down to the Best Western to check in and OF COURSE there was an issue. I could not check in because my reservation was canceled. Best Western told me to call Super.com AGAIN and ask them to resubmit the digital payment. So I did. Only to be informed that i would have to wait ONE HOUR for a response, which did not even gaurantee my stay. FRUSTRATED, I waited. I recieved no response. NOT EVEN TO THIS DAY... Twice I was denied a room because of the issuses with Super.com. I had to book a DIFFERENT ROOM with a janky hotel becasue Super.com failed to meet their end of the deal. I called Super.com back the evening of Sat. Dec 2nd and told them to cancel everything and refund me. I still have had no response. This company is not for the customer what so ever. They did nothing to assure I was satisfied. They did nothing to accomodate my needs. They gave me the run around and STILL WONT REFUND ME.. ON THEIR OWN MISTAKES."

I booked a family vacation with them for my daughter's 6th birthday. My mom who was also supposed to join us on the trip DIED. YUP. SHE DIED. The day before my daughter's birthday. Trip was cancelled immediately. I called them and informed them. I sent all the necessary documents they asked me for. They said they would make the exception due to my mother passing. It's been a month. I've been calling because that money needed to go towards the funeral my siblings and I had to pay for. I told every worker I spoke to the situation and they all said the same thing. They will informed the department in charge of that. So I said okay. Can you transfer me through to that department. The person kept avoiding the question. But I think they are trained to avoid the question because this happened on many occasions. The first 3 or 4 people I spoke to said my refund should be here in 3-5 business days. Call back if you don't receive it. So I called back because I didn't receive it. Then they told me that I had to wait 14 business days. Until they make a decision. Then they said they gotta double check. I will be taking them to court and getting a lawyer because this is crazyyyyy. It's been a MONTH!!! Do not use this company AT ALL. Spend the necessary money you have to for happiness. Because this company ain't it."

I booked two Diamond package junior suite rooms at the Royalton in Saint Lucia from 11/25/23 to 11/30/23 through your website. I paid the full amount in advance, as per your policy, and received a confirmation email with the details of my booking. However, when I arrived at the hotel, I was shocked to learn that they had no record of my booking as Diamond package junior suite rooms. Instead, they found that my booking was for regular rooms, which are much smaller and less luxurious than what I had paid for. They also informed me that my original booking was cancelled by your agent- Hotel Beds Worldwide, based in Punta Cana on October 18, 2023, and re-booked on October 21, 2023, without my approval or notification. I have a screenshot from Royaltons system confirming the cancellation and rebooking. Why was there a need to do that ? Why was it done without Clients consent. This is a clear case of fraud and deception on your part, and I demand an explanation for this unacceptable behavior. I had to spend hours at the hotel reception with my 6 months pregnant wife who had to go through this hassle following our travel, trying to sort out this mess where I was literally being tossed between the resort and the agent. I talked to a minimum of 6-7 of your representatives who were all unhelpful and unsure if they even understood my concern. On top of that, while my case was still unresolved, Super Travel agents closed my tickets without any resolution whatsoever. Extremely disappointing and frustrating. I had chosen the Diamond package junior suite rooms because I was on my Babymoon and the other suite had special amenities and services that I wanted to enjoy during my vacation, such as a private balcony, a jacuzzi, a minibar, and a personal concierge. I feel cheated and misled by your company, and I want a full refund for the entire amount I paid, plus compensation for the damages you caused me. I have attached copies of my confirmation email, my payment receipt, and the hotel invoice as proof of my claim. I expect a prompt and satisfactory response from you, with an apology and a confirmation of the refund and compensation. If I do not hear from you within 10 days, I will take legal action against you and report you to the relevant authorities. I hope you will take this matter seriously and resolve it as soon as possible."

When the guest arrived at my hotel the Virtual Credit Card that Super.com provided did not go through. We immediately informed the guest that the payment method on file did not work. They provided an alternative payment method. We charged that card. After the guest checked out I received a phone call stating that he had now been charged twice. I advised the guest to contact Super.com to explain that their card had not worked and to refund his money. They then told him to call back to the hotel and request a refund from the hotel. I explained to him that we were unable to provide a refund due to no other payment had been made. I attempted to speak to some one requesting for the Virtual card to be reopened however nothing has occurred. I have now been on hold waiting for a rep for over 15 minutes just to be told that the urgent response team would be contacting me back. This is the 6th time that I have been told this. I have told the client to request a charge-back on their credit card due to Super.com apparently does not care nor guarantee their bookings. We work with many 3rd party booking sites and this has been the absolute worst experience I have had with any of them."

We recommend requesting refunds well before your check-in date, and our support team is available 24/7 to assist you. You say to contact you, but there is no way to contact you. Your phone numbers dont work. You cannot reach a human being unless you do a chat, which I tried but, again you say to contact you but you actually dont help. in the statement that you make on your website and thru your chat bot you say to contact you and youll contact the hotel to see if theyll give you a refund, but that is entirely up to the hotel. That is fine but, Im not trying to change anything, so why cant you actually call to see if I can make it refundable and by just charging me the difference of what it wouldve been if the booking was refundable and making it a refundable booking.

        "Details": "Hi I wish to complain & seek redress regarding our booking. Our booking Confrmation Voucher (which I still have and can forward to you), makes it clear that we booked was a 'Junior Suite Standard' at the hotel 'R2 Romantic Fantasia Dreams' for the booking dates. The reception / administration for this hotel is at the 'R2 Bahia Design Hotel', which is next door. When we arrived and checked in, we were provided with a junior suite at the R2 Bahia Design hotel itself. We were told that we had to be accomodated in the main hotel (a cheaper hotel), since there were no junior suites at the R2 Fantasia Dreams. I queried this because pictures on your website showed photos of suites at the Fantasia site, and I was told that the 'R2 Romantic Fantasia Suites' were a further separate (3rd) site, and that we had not booked & paid for that, and in any event, none were available. (The suites at R2 Romantic Fantasia Suites are larger with a separate lounge where a bed can be placed for a 3rd person. This is not the case at the R2 Bahia Design Hotel, where suites are one room and are therefore unsuitable for 3 people. I have to be clear that in my mind, as per our booking voucher, I had booked and paid for a junior suite for 3 people at the R2 Fantasia Dreams' site, which we now told does not exist. We were later additionally told that follow up enquiries had been made with the R2 hotels booking centre, which confirmed that the error had been made by Super.com. We were therefore not provided with any compensation by the hotel. Since we have returned home, I have checked our account with Super.com, and I can see that our 'trips' section now confirms us as having stayed at the R2 Bahia Design Hotel, and not at the R2 Romantic Fantasia Dreams, which our original booking voucher shows. I therefore request compensation because the suite we were provided at Bahia Design hotel is apparently cheaper than a suite at R2 Romantic Fantasia, which I had booked and did not recieve. Yours sincerely Kevin Claxton"

They then continue to tell you the hotel has to deal with it but the hotels can not because this third party company is the one that takes the payment. And it says right on their *** website that they will contact the hotel. Also states While were committed to advocating on your behalf, please know that the final decision lies with their travel partners. also well advocate vigorously for you. The lady at the hotel kindly cancelled my reservation and told me I should be getting a full refund from them. She wrote and email stating everything as such and I shared it with super.com customer service. I haven't heard anything back from super.com. I have to keep calling and ask whats going on and they cant tell me. Last night the guy I talked to said the email was missing some things, so I got him to tell me what it needed to have and then he told me once they have that, a refund is no problem at all. I resent the email this morning with everything they requested that the hotel sent me. Again, left me hanging. So I called back again tonight They don't have a direct number to the reimbursement/refund department. They can't transfer me either. They have no way to contact them he said. HE ACTUALLY SAID IN THE CONVERSATION THAT THEY DONT HAVE A REFUND/REIMBURSEMENT DEPARTMENT. I told him I wanted to speak to someone in charge... a manager, owner, anyone. He said they can only take information and also kept saying he doesn't understand that one. I asked him if this was a fake company. He said it wasn't. I said I don't believe that one bit. I told him I wanted this dealt with because they are doing everything in their power to feed me *** and I'm tired of it. This company is a joke. Look around for reviews.. you will see. Any good reviews are probably posted on their behalf. They lie to you and then leave you hanging."

The ordeal was so exasperating that I felt compelled to share my ordeal, hoping that no one else falls into the same trap.

Before I knew it, I had paid for a hotel reservation on the very same day I intended to stay, despite my explicit selection of November 8th. I immediately realized the error and attempted to rectify it by contacting their customer service. However, this presented another challenge. It took several attempts to reach a live representative, which was incredibly frustrating. When I finally got through, the individual I spoke to was unable to resolve my issue. This lack of effective customer support only added to my mounting frustration. The crux of the problem lies in the website's design and functionality, which makes it extremely easy for users to inadvertently book the wrong date. Super.com's website is designed in a way that appears user-friendly, but it masks its true intent to trick unsuspecting customers into making erroneous bookings. It leaves little room for users to review their selections and confirm their choices before proceeding to payment. In sum, my experience with Super.com was nothing short of a nightmare. The combination of their deceptive website design and the lack of responsive customer support left me feeling duped and frustrated. I sincerely hope that by sharing my experience, others can avoid falling victim to this misleading platform. My advice: approach Super.com with extreme caution, and double-check your reservations meticulously before clicking that payment button."

Contacted Super to see how long it will take to receive a refund but was advised by an agent to speak with the hotel staff to see if I can modify the dates first. I did what was advised, but was told they couldn't do it because it was booked on a 3rd party site. Contacted Super back with this and was told they couldn't modify the dates and I couldn't get a refund because my reason doesn't fit their insurance policy. I don't reside in the state I'm staying at and plan to return home soon to my elderly dad. Just recently, I came to the state to help my daughter and grandchild. I'm not a wealthy person and don't have a lot of money to throw away. I have a lot of people that depends on my financial aid. So, every cent counts. I wouldn't have expected to have to go through so much to receive a refund. This situation is becoming so stressful. I'm hoping Super does the right thing and help me resolve this issue in a timely manner."

The next morning when I contacted them again they told me that they had received the review it was approved and that I would receive a full refund within five to seven business days.

We had contracted the hotel because on line it appeared to be a very nice extended stay hotel. We had had great experiences before. Super.com as a third party is supposed to provide quality service and customer satisfaction. Upon arrival, the desk attendant suggested that my family and I go to the room to see the room before finalizing the reservation stay. We were very surprised! We went to the room. Doors were falling off the cabinets. There was a HUGE hole in the bathroom door and it smelled very bad, as if someone had been smoking drugs in the room. Horrible! The desk attendant immediately returned our money, a total of over $500 for a 5 day stay to Super.com immediately. We have been fighting for 3 weeks to get our money back that they demanded upfront, a total of $504.75. They have demanded that we go back to the hotel and get the details stating that they had returned the money to Super.com. THAT HOTEL RESERVATION WITH ALL THE INFORMATION IS ALREADY IN THE SUPER.COM SYSTEM! But they have not wanted to return our reservation funds to us. We have called Super.com 3 times. We have called the hotel itself and they have said that they cannot send that information because Super.com is a third party business. With all due respect to the well being of the traveler and the community, do NOT make any reservations through Super.com. If there are any reservation problems, they only think of the money that they are losing, not their service to the customer and the community!"

So I went back and forth with mangers and supervisors with both parties & each was still saying the same thing. So I got nowhere."

I spend 4 hours in parking lot calling and emailing super.com to be told oh yes your reservation will be good at no additional charge to you that they had a glitch that posted room for $45 a night. First Lady I talked to was real nice. She said yes we will fix reservation at no additional cost to you we screwed up. Well after several more emails and another phone call all super.com could do was reimburse my credit card and offer me 10% off of my stay on their site for my next booking. Which was $30 but I'll not be booking here again. They finally told me the hotel could not receive payment over the phone so all the could do was reimburse my money for the reservation. I feel they should stand by their word! They tell me they will and then they don't! I'm glad I was reimbursed my money, but I'll not go thru the headache for four hours to use their site again!"

My mother had a stroke on 6/7/23 and I traveled from NC to MD to be with her. On 6/8/23 I contacted Super Travel and requested to cancel and be refunded. On 6/8/23 I also called the hotel directly and explained my situation and requested a refund. The hotel was very accommodating and said I could absolutely cancel my reservation. They also told me that SuperTravel was difficult to work with and if they denied my request for a refund to tell them verbatim: \"I understand you're following you're policy but may I please speak to your supervisor. Please send me an email notification confirming a full refund and any penalty will be waived. If they say hotel won't cancel \"How can I get a credit so I can rebook thru you?\" On 6/8/23 I received the following email from SuperTravel: \"Hi Jessica, I am Mari from SuperTravel. I am reaching out because the hotel contacted us to let us know that they have approved a FOC Cancellation for your booking on 09 Jun 2023. We just want to confirm that you would like to cancel this booking.\" I responded via email on 6/8/23 and confirmed the cancellation. I heard nothing further from SuperTravel nor did I receive a credit. On both 6/27/23 and 7/11/23, I emailed SuperTravel: \"Please advise when I will be refunded $406.92. Thanks\" On 7/23/23 I received the following email from SuperTravel: \"Hi Jessica, It's Maria here from Super Travel. I am following up on your ticket for booking B_942****. Unfortunately our travel partners denied confirmation for the free of charge cancellation and so we will not be able to process a refund. We understand this may not be the outcome you expected and want to reassure we did our best. Thank you for understanding.\" I called, online chat, and emailed SuperTravel numerous times requesting a refund and they have refused."

As of today Sept 13, the Hotel STILL does not have the booking in their reservation system. I have called, and e-mailed, repeatedly since making the reservation, was told that \"Don't worry, your reservation is confirmed\" but they REFUSE to put me in touch with a Supervisor or Manager, despite repeatedly asking to speak with one. I was told I would receive a call back in 24-48 hours, but no call backs from anyone. Sometimes, I received an e-mail back stating \"We are working on resolving your issue\". If I respond to that e-mail, I get back nothing. I have contacted the Hotel repeatedly as well and they confirm that this site has a history of not having legitimate reservations. The Super.com actually states that sometimes the reservation does not appear in the Hotel Booking system until day of check in!!! Are we really that naive and would accept a booking that cannot be confirmed with the property? Needless to say, I have cancelled the reservation and am awaiting credit card return credit. I already anticipate issues with getting the refund as well."

Clearly i wouldnt book in my city when i live there and im not going to be here anyway. It took over an hour to get through to them just for them to tell me they cant do anything as there is no cancelation policy, funny i did click the cancellation button. So i asked to speak to the supervisor to c if i can just get it transfered to the hotel in the city i wanted it in and the guy said theres no supervisor so he will fill out a ticket for them to get back to me in a day or 2..wtf i have to check in tomorrow so how will that help me so he said he will rush ticket so supervisor will call me in the next 2 -3 hrs. So most likely im out $233 and change and now have no hotel and im definitely not rich enough to go get another one so im kinda *** now. Dont ever book with these rop off artists. Who cant even have their websitr set up properly to book hotels in the proper city that you are booking at. Thanks super.com guess i have to miss my grand baby being born and my other ones 11th bday."

Being in a hurry, trying to get clothes ironed and unpacking things needed to get ready I was shocked by the unclean bathroom! The toilet had urine on the seat, on the rim and on the floor, there was a half used shampoo bottle in the shower and a hair in the sink. Being in a hurry I didn't have time to ask for another room... SO... I grabbed a wash cloth and quickly cleaned the mess! Pulled out my Lysol (never travel without it) and saturated the entire bathroom!! Was too tired after the event to bother with talking to management at that time. But, I did tell the clerk as I was checking out, thinking maybe she would offer a small discount for the dirty bathroom...all that I got was a quick \"I'm sorry, do you need a receipt\" Needless to say I am totally dissatisfied with this matter!!"

The website picture portrayed this Best Western as modern and lovely. When I checked in, only 2 luggage carts were on site. None were available and no one offered to help. The pool was broken which was advertised to be available. I have Ulcerative Colitis for which I take infusions of Remicade at a local cancer institute. I have a handicapped parking sticker due to back problems and am also suffering from kidney disease and allergies to mold and mildew. My 85 year old mother was with me who is a heart patient and also has a handicapped parking sticker. I struggled and took a suitcase to my room which I found to be deplorable. It reeked of mold and mildew which took my breath away and caused my eyes to water and nose to become stuffy along with throat tightness and pain. The room looked dirty and appeared to have not been updated since the 1940 to 1960 era. I was forced to book a room at another hotel due to the conditions of the Best Western Fort Washington. The manager has not responded to my voice mail message but did tell me in person on the afternoon of August 25, 2023 that she would refund my money. I called the hotel for an e mail address for the manager and the clerk refused to provide it. The clerk also refused to transfer me to someone else for assistance. Please be advised that I did not cancel the reservation. I left the hotel because of the health problems it may have caused me and my mother. The conditions were uninhabitable and were fraudulently advertised. I expect this matter to be resolved to my satisfaction immediately upon receipt of this complaint. Govern yourselves accordingly.

I paid for a room that was never used, refused a refund, spoken rudely to, and had my client sleep on the street that night until I was able to find other accommodations for her. As a business owner and ministry professional, this is the worst customer service I have ever seen. I would never treat a client, customer, or person in such a rude, condescending manner. This desk clerk should be fired.

It's very misleading for customer to pay unexpected charge. Today when we checked out they asked me to pay $200 for some strange fee which is experience fee that covers room service, using Wi-Fi which was stated as free in the hotel, using lift, computer which we never used. Usually when we book room that covers all that. Also, if these charges are mandatory then they should be part of the price so customers wouldn't mislead about the price. Hotel receptionist told me that experience charges are mandatory, so it should be added in total price. If we know that to pay $200 extra for experience charges then I must not book the hotel. What we are paying for then? Only the bed in the room? This is totally unfair and I am so upset with that. This is why they show less price and later charged via hotel. super.com are not positive with this complaint. It is responsibility of the super.com to contact the hole and manage the refund. Because mandatory charges must be part of the usual price. Booking number B_1023****"

        "Details": "I booked a reservation for a hotel after my house caught fire and a second reservation was accidentally made. I contacted SuperTravel and a customer service rep told me my funds would be reissued in 2-3 business days. That did not occur. I called them back multiple times and finally got them to escalate the call to a manager, Mark Louie. He called me back and the phone rang 3 times and disconnected - I did not have time to catch the call before he hung up. He then responded via email (despite my request for a phone call) stating the reservation was non refundable and I needed a letter with signatures from the hotel owner and others stating they could refund me. I responded via email that they need to check my call where the customer service rep said I would be refunded. I emailed them 2-3 times with no response. I called back multiple times and Mark Louie called me back, only repeating it was non refundable and then the phone disconnected mid conversation. I tried calling back repeatedly but never heard from him again. I finally got the information of a new Supervisor, Annie, who was sympathetic to my situation and agreed they should honor what I was told originally and that she would negotiate a deal. I then received an Email from her stating I would not be refunded without that letter. My father passed away a month after the fire and I do not have time to jump through hoops, especially after I was told by the company I would receive my refund. A legitimate, reputable company would stay true to their word and not fight someone in their time of need. They are not a honorable and trustworthy business and I can only feel as though I've been scammed. And if you have to contact them after your reservation has been made, good luck getting through to them, especially if you need to speak to a manager. Beware doing business with SuperTravel"

After following up with the hotel, we learned that they did not receive the money for one of the rooms from super.com (their \"virtual credit card\" was declined), so they had to charge my father's card. This borders on fraudulent activity by super.com, and raises severe concerns about the legality of your business operations, and certainly about their solvency. I demand that the price paid for my father's room is promptly refunded to my MasterCard. Otherwise, we will need to hand this matter over to the police in San Francisco."

I made reservations thur Super.com on 8/4/23 for Candlewood Suites check in on 8/6/23 with check out 8/13/23. They never received the $697.07 that Super.com took from my account on 8/4/23 when I booked the room.I had to pay $85.80 for 7 days since they didnt received my money so I ended up paying additional $600.60 total of $1297.67.for my 7 day stay.. I have requested daily to get my money.. Sent the receipt from hotel proving that Super.com never forwarded my payment, then told their procedure was after they received the hotel receipt I would get refund right away. Then on 8/10/23 said had to wait 5 to 7 days for refund.. Today has been 10 days since I should have gotten refund and NOONE can explain why my money was not transfered to the hotel or refunded back. I am taking further actions filing charges with police tomorrow and seeing attorney on Thursday after charges are filed. I will not let them get away with this. PLEASE DON'T DO ANY TYPE OF BUSINESS WITH SUPER.COM. THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY. Larry Holliman"

So I said excuse me. Did you say something and she said no no? Go ahead and I know for sure that they are not working out of an office because I heard a gentleman whispering to her in the background. So I am very shocked to say that someone would laugh at someone. Having to sleep in their car because they're funds where held. Buy a third party company then she proceeded to tell me. That they were not the ones holding my money and my bank. Was? So. I asked her if she had a minute because I was going to screenshot my bank statement. With their companies name on the whole and also screenshot Myra seat. With the date time. And I'm out on it. And guess what? About 2 seconds later. I heard my phone beat twice and I looked down at my phone and she hung up on me. That is very unprofessional. Thank you."

The lack of communication on their part left me stranded in the rain with no alternative accommodation. When I finally managed to speak with an agent named Christine, her response was that they were \"investigating\" the situation. However, despite her assurance, I received no further updates or communication from the company. My attempts to reach out to their customer service were met with empty promises of a callback within 30 minutes, which never materialized. It's now August 8, 2023, and I'm still left in the dark about my refund or any resolution to the matter. The Super travel app's behavior is alarming and raises serious concerns about their business practices. This isn't simply a case of poor customer service; it appears to be a systematic issue that warrants thorough investigation and resolution. The Super travel app's handling of my situation is deeply troubling, and I urge them to take immediate action to rectify this matter. Until then, I can only caution others to exercise extreme caution when dealing with this company, as their actions indicate a potential scam and fraudulent practices."

I wanted reservation to be moved from a Friday night to Thursday night and was willing to take pay more, but didn't want to lose the whole night that I paid for when I mistakenly picked the wrong date. This was the typical customer service received in this day and age. We as consumers make things easier by doing all the work now online, in the grocery stores etc. and they won't allow for a honest mistake. I decided I will not book another hotel room or anything that is not direct with the provider (ex. hotel, car rental etc.) Probably doesn't matter and won't help.

I called and nobody wanted to correct this problem told me basically I was screwed because there were no refunds or modifications. I would understand if I messed up and purposely bought 2 rooms but this was a glitch in Your app so basically you guys robbed me of $80. And nobody would make it right not even the supervisor. Also after I got checking things out I noticed that 4 more charges tried to go through for more separate rooms. All I can say is it's a good thing Venmo has a conscience and good customer service because they corrected y'all's mistake. And for the rating if I could I'd give you guys 0000000's. Because you could have modified the date or corrected this just as easy as Venmo or the hotel I stayed at. Who by the way the motel also was able to fix YOUR MISTAKE!"

I was forced to book a room with the hotel on my own at a much higher rate, and at my own expense, even though I had already paid Super for the reservation. I did so at the same hotel. I called customer service and was told I would be reimbursed for the charges within 3-5 days by emailing the receipt from the hotel for the charges I incurred. I did so the night my stay ended. After receiving no response, I followed up by email again only to be told that the hotel partner indicated I was a no show and I would not be reimbursed (The receipt I provided was for the SAME HOTEL I BOOKED WITH SUPER.COM). I called again and was told that the decision was based upon the Hilton Orlando indicating I was a no show, a hotel more than 3,000 miles away from the hotel I booked. I have called 4 times over the last week. Each time I was told I would be called back within 45 minutes by someone who could help me. NO ONE HAS EVER CALLED ME! NO ONE HAS REIMBURSED ME!!!

        "Details": "Heres my story. On 13 June I had necessity to stop my trip in the US because my mom was sick. I went to the airport (Springfield, MO) and tried to get a ticket to Italy, to go back home. I had a round trip ticket, but my return flight was planning for June 24. It was unusable because I couldnt change the dates. I decided to get tickets from skyscanner.com. It gave me SnapTravel as the only solution. I was in hurry and I decided to buy the tickets without checking the reviews of that travel agency. I am not stupid. I thought that skyscanner.com only had legit agencies with good reviews in its database. After I authorized the payment ( 1,446.36) they sent me an email with a confirmation number but no tickets. After several minutes I received another e-mail that said Your order could not be completed. Please note that refunds may take several business days to post back to your account. We look forward to hearing from you next time you travel. I was able to contact the lady that worked at Traveler Helpdesk She sent me the following message Thank you for reaching out to us. Unfortunately, we are unable to confirm the flight for you at the price that you approved, and we could not find anything close to it as well. As a result, your order was canceled and the refund is in the priority queue and we will send you the refund receipt once completed. We apologize for the inconvenience. Please check with your bank for your funds' availability. Turnaround time may vary coming from your financial institution. After a few days SnapTravel disappeared and all its contacts (email addresses, phone numbers etc.) were disabled. I found out that they changed the name and now they are called Super.com. I sent an e-mail to them a week ago by PissedConsumer. They sent me the following message We are sorry to bring the bad news to you. Looks like Super com received but decided not to read and act upon your message. Being patient did not pay off at the end of the day. You can always go further and let others know about your situation by posting a review. Let them know how Super com treats its clients.

        "Titles": "Horrible Experience",
        "Details": "I recently stayed one night with you at the Avion Inn Near LGA Airport (from 16-17 June 2023), and it was a pretty wretched experience. I travel a great deal in my line of work, and I know the normal problems with hotels, but this was just a cacophony of irritations that literally impacted my entire stay and entire trip. For what it's worth, I have NEVER sent a complaint response to any business in all my life, but this situation was so irksome and so negatively impacted my stay, that I felt compelled to write. I know that Avion is a discount hotel, and I was prepared for that. I wasnt, however, prepared for the following. My room was located in the basement less than 2 feet from traffic, incoming guests, multiple arguments, and other problems. The noise was non-stop. NON-STOP! In the early AM, I had about 2 hours of nothing by backup alarms. The wifi did not work. The dorm fridge wasnt cold. The desk to work at was so rickety that I was worried it would collapse if I put my laptop on it. The TV only tuned to a casino page with a QR code and nothing else worked. Whats that about?? The thermostat was broken so it was impossible to actually read the temperature, so I just had to fidget with it for hours to find a livable temperature. It was pretty hideous overall. That begin said, the staff was very friendly, and the man who drove the airport shuttle in the morning was a delight. Of course, the hotel wasnt running a shuttle when I arrived to LaGuardia, but thats just another part of the bad list. In any event, perhaps this will just go to the junk/spam folder, and I know this all sounds like whining, but it really (quite seriously) impacted an already problematic night. I mean, it was bad."

Unfortunately our travel partners denied confirmation for the free of charge cancellation and so we will not be able to process a refund. We understand that you were hoping for a refund, and we're sorry to say that it's not always possible for us to secure one.

I immediately started a chat to let them know I did not get this information and it was too late for me to use it (settled in another room). After awhile \"chatting\", first with a robot and then two different agents after one just disappeared for half an hour, I was told a refund would be issued as soon as I send the hotel invoice. It was now several hours later and after midnight. I message back, how do I get that without being there? Can't you just cancel and prevent an invoice being generated? I fell asleep awaiting a response and woke the next morning to none. I started the chat back up when I got home 3 days later only to be informed it is not refundable according to policy and when I posted the screen shots indicating I would be refunded, the rep and the chat screen all just shut off. I think this company might be a scam. If they are a legitimate business, this is a horrible way to build your business."

        "Titles": "Horrible Experience.",
        "Details": "I would give 0 stars if I could. I booked a reservation on your website and was sent a reservation for a standard one bed room when your site clearly showed a price for two beds, as you can see from the attached pictures in my review. I got someone in the Philippines named Leona, she said I will need to charge you a cancelation fee. I said why would you charge me anything, you should just fix my reservation to what I booked. She said I am on the site and there is no issues and we have had no other complaints, like I am lying. Well as you can see from the attached pictures in the review I am telling the truth. I asked for a supervisor and she said they were just going to tell me the exact same thing as she was telling me and they would not fix it, because I booked the wrong room. I booked the room your site showed me as two beds. I booked this for 3 men, and it says 3. Why would I ever book one queen bed for 3 grown big men. I will never ever use your service again and will warn others to not use it also. Your company is dishonest and will not fix your issues and work to make things right. as you can see from the pictures I posed in the review the total for 2 beds was 110.00 per night and with taxes and fees a total of $134.91. Traveling is supposed to be fun, not a nightmare with no one at Super to listen to your issue. It was the most stressful situation I have ever had with any company. I have noticed more and more that customer service employees in the Philippines are getting smart with US citizens and are not trying to help them resolve issues. Customer Service is horrible and only threatened me with fees and blamed me for messing up, when its their system that messed up. You know this is not a way to grow your business. Do you not know that word of mouth matters. If you provide good service and listen to your customers they will tell others to you. It take 10 happy customers to grow your business and 1 upset to help you lose business. No matter how big your company is, customer success equals your success. Accelerate the growth of your business by focusing on growing a loyal customer base that helps increase sales. So another agent Filipino agent called me back within the hour saying he was a supervisor. I am almost certain he was no supervisor but possibly a coworker of Leona's. He would not give me his name. I tried to tell him my issue and he cut me off and said he was not going to help me. He said it was my fault and my mistake. While trying to explain my issue to him, he told me that I talked to much. By this time I got really angry. I yelled how dare you tell a customer they are talking to much. This time he talked down to me and then hung up on me. First of all I have always trained all my Customer Service staff to never hang up on a customers unless they are verbally abusing them with foul language. I tell them never cut a person off and listen to them and make them feel their valued and that their complaint is important and listen to them. Work with them. I offered to send them pictures of what I saw on my end and of what I booked, they were not interested at all. I was so angry after this. He was untrained and horrible. The worst yet. Customer Service in the Philippines is horrible these day. They simply do not care. Leona told me I would need a letter from The hotel asking them to cancel the reservation. I said I don't want to cancel I want you to fix this to the room I booked. The hotel said have them call and we can cancel it and we can rebook the room with two beds for you. I showed them the pictures from the website and dynasty agreed with me. They said its clearly two beds showing on their site. The customer service agent I got said they never call the hotels. The hotel said all the other sites we work with do, Expedia, Priceline, and others. We cancel and have them refund all the time when an issue like this arises. I asked for Leona's Employee Identifier and she said we are not permitted to give you anything but our first name. I even spoke to another customer service agent who did not give me her name and had a dog barking in the background. These people need to be back in the office already and they need call service monitoring and supervision. They must have management overseeing what they are doing. They are rude and do not care."
