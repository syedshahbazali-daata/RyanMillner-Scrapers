We love hearing about how you use our tools and what would make them better. This guide is here to help you understand how the product feedback process works, and how to write an effective feedback post. You may also want to check out this short video on giving product feedback at Zendesk.This topic is for product feedback about the ticketing system. Don't worry, if your post should be in another topic, the Zendesk Community Team will move your post to the correct topic.Here are a few guidelines on how to use the Product Feedback topic, so that our Product team can effectively use and apply your feedback to our product planning process:Follow the Community Code of ConductFeedback and constructive criticism are welcome. Disparaging, harassing, mean, or snarky remarks about Zendesk, its employees, vendors, partners, or other community members will not be tolerated. We’re all friends and professionals, so let’s keep it polite. We don’t like having to remove comments, but we reserve the right to do so without warning in order to maintain a positive community experience for everyone.If it's a bug, contact supportThis topic is for sharing ideas about the product. If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions. We value all feedback and we're happy to have a place to engage in these conversations.",Feedback - Admin Center

This format is meant to help our PM’s get the most information from you to better understand and log your requests. This format will be rolled out at the end of 2023 and will be enforced as a requirement for all new posts to be logged and/or responded to by product managers.EXAMPLE:TITLE: Pizza Order ButtonPlease give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.].

How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)I would like to see an option to order pizza in the upper right hand corner of my screen, represented by a pizza emoji which, when I click it, will take me directly to an order form for my nearest pizza shop.

(2-3 sentences)As an admin, I would like to be able to review macro usage over a monthly period. As an admin, I occasionally monitor macro usage to identify whether there are any trigger/automation refinement opportunities. Sorting the last 7 days column from high to low helps identify which macros are being used most - including a 30 day bracket would provide more info.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)We have monthly cycles where at the close of the month we'll see an increase by some teams with higher ticket volume, whereas they may not be used very much during other periods of the month. To identify when that's happening, or other unknown periods when there may be a spike, including the 30-day bracket would minimize the need to check on a weekly basis.When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool?

Sydney Neubauer,Features to Restrict by Brand,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6383796950042-Features-to-Restrict-by-Brand,11/15/2023,"Please give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.].We request complete Brand segregation that extends beyond just tickets and end-users. We want to restrict Agents/Admins, phone numbers, settings, Chat CSAT, email template, contextual workspaces, layout builder, triggers, automations, macros, dynamic content, etc. This would impact everyone in Zendesk as well as the business as a whole as there are teams that can handle their own BrandWhat problem do you see this solving?Right now it is an all or nothing approach to a lot of features which means that it solely falls on Admins and it is a setting that impacts the entire instance.When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business?We are impacted everyday as there is always something an Admin needs to do and when they do it, they have to implement it for everyone.ie. We add phone numbers daily to ZD, which just keeps adding to the list of phone numbers listed in the Talk Console. Agents use the wrong numbers all the time and there are deletion restrictions set up on some so recordings get deleted when they shouldn't just because they used the wrong number (for a group they don't have access to)ie. We can't turn on Chat CSAT as it is a system wide setting and one Brand cannot have it on. As such, we need to look into a separate instance just to turn on Chat CSAT for Brand as it is a business requirementie. We have Managers that want to be admins to handle just their Brand items (triggers, automations) but that would mean they can access HR/IT tickets as well as their setup, so it falls to the system wide Admins and gets bottleneckedie. We want to roll out contextual workspaces but anyone can create or edit workspaces. As such, it would be too much monitoring/training to ensure that they don't make a workspace for team they aren't part of OR edit a workspace that does not belong to them.ie. We have to coordinate among all Brands to get a unified sense of Branding. If they don't then we need to find common ground/custom coding. It is so much work and as such, there are changes we have made where a team had to get a developer involved to create custom code to keep the previous branding.ie. Macro permissions are you either can have group editing or all editing. As such, each group associated with the Brand needs to be added to the macro. If that is too much work, they have to request someone with all macro access to create the macro and specify it is only for a certain Brand which produces the chance that another Brand uses it.ie. We have triggers that are setup per Brand. Either you have all access or you don't. So we had an instance where a manager was an admin so they edited triggers that impacted other Brands without proper process for the other teams and it caused an escalation.ie. When we get a spam caller, we block the number but it may be spam for one Brand but not another. It needs to be agreed upon that this caller cannot contact any BrandAre you currently using a workaround to solve this problem?Yes - We are restricting Admins and having workflows where tickets need to be submitted, reviewed by an admin and put in backlog (too many requests)Yes - We have to set up regular meetings to talk about changes that will impact everyone and then wait for approval for each Brand. Which can take months.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function?Admins: Ability to set Admins to be in charge of certain Brands - so they can't make any edits to features that are outside of their Brands. Anything outside their Brand can be chosento what they can see (read-only vrs no access). Ability to set if they can access tickets outside their Brand (read-only, ability to edit or only able to search but not open, or see only ticket events and not comments) - helps with troubleshooting.There are Admins dedicated to all system settings (role creation/editing, group creation/deletion, onboarding/offboarding/email template updates etc) so we would want more granular sub permissions for Brand Admins to ensure they can't do certain tasks.Brand based settings/visibility: Every setting that is system wide should be able to be set per Brand, or an option that states ""apply to all brands"" so that you don't need to duplicate the work/effortWhen you perform rule analysis, you can see Brand based settings (states it impacts all, or just this Brand)You can set Triggers/SLAs/Dynamic Content/Views/Macros etc to be tied specificallyto Brands so it is easier to search/filter and can be implemented without impacting everyone in the instance (Instances within instances)RelatedRestricting tickets visibility to Brand – Zendesk helphttps://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6224169063066-Talk-Admin-Centre-UI-overhaulFeature request: Contextual workspace for – Zendesk helphttps://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/4408868196890-Feature-Request-Additional-Contextual-Workspace-options",Feedback - Admin Center

When managing organizations with many Custom Roles, the only way to get a view of all Licensed agents is to use the Filters to select each role individually, which is clunky, and requires exact knowledge of which roles consume licenses or are forms of Light Agent.There doesn't appear to be any way to sort or filter for Suspension Status currently either.Finally, it would be useful to be able to manage (or at least View/Sort) Agent Groups and Tags.

This is an excessive access restriction and causes access inconvenience to agents.What I wantThe setting I want, and according to Korea's personal information protection laws, is ""Restrict access to admin."" According to the Personal Information Protection Act of the Republic of Korea, administrators are “personal information processors” and their access needs to be restricted.(Administrators should not access the agent UI - which may contain personal information - from anywhere.)However, I am forced to use IP address restrictions to satisfy this law. I would like the functionality to be granular so that IP address restrictions may or may not be set per custom role on the agent.If that happens, I hope to set access restrictions for administrators and turn off access restrictions for regular agents so that agents can use Zendesk more conveniently than they do now.I look forward to positive feedback from your team.Thank you.",Feedback - Admin Center

On the other hand, these permissions are configurable for other licenses.I understand that there are serious limitations to access governance with regard to custom objects (ie macro bypass of permissions on other roles), and I assume that is inherent to the architecture. However, since other roles can have their access configured, it seems like this restriction on modifications is arbitrary.Custom objects could include sensitive data relevant to work done by private groups and should not be accessible to our light agents, contributors, or other members not in the private group. In the same way as ticket access can be customized.To enforce effective user access governance, the custom object permissions should be configurable for light agent and contributor roles in the same way as ticket access can be customized.Please give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.].

While full licenses for agents can have their custom permissions restricted, due to the fixed config of light agents and contributors, admins cannot customize their access to these data assets.What problem do you see this solving?

In this case, a passive update would be one where the order is updated because some other view was moved, and an active update would be one where the 'save' button was actually used (ie. edit to criteria, displayed fields, user access).Generally this is noticeable whenever we create a new view - typically for testing - and move it to the top of the list of views.

Currently, it looks like the only way to accomplish this is through some custom tooling of webhooks and APIs, as detailed in these posts:https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/4409515169306-Using-Liquid-Markup-to-A-B-Test-Your-Triggershttps://roca.work/blog/ab-testing-in-zendeskI'm personally learning about Webhooks and APIs as I can to try and skill up to do this, but it's a pretty significant barrier to entry that requires some very specific technical knowledge. As we're definitely not the first to try and accomplish this goal (as per the existence of these articles), a native A/B testing solution in Zendesk would be amazing.Boiled down to the simplest requirement, all that's really needed to make this feasible is a trigger or rule that causes all incoming tickets to be tagged as A or B (or A/B/C, A/B/C/D, depending on the test) and alternate between them / rotate through the list. Then with a test group (A) and a control (B), abracadabra, you have working A/B testing in Zendesk.For a short term fix, would it be possible for an Engineer to implement trigger conditions / logic that achieve the described rotation above?",Feedback - Admin Center

As our Company grows, the Talk Admin Centre becomes more and more unnavigable. This increases human error, increases resolution time, decreases productivity. There are many changes that can be made to help increase quality of life (outlined below)Admins are the ones that interact with the Talk admin center but when it is a request from the business, they get impacted when we can't give them updates/answers right away. In the end, this impacts everyone in one way or another. And it impacts the product if our experience is less than perfect as a lot of the changes/information rely on manual effortWhat problem do you see this solving?Easier updates, quicker turnaround times, less frustration, additional workflow options, easier training, decreased impact when errors occur, decreased chance for human error, better organizationWhen was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business?Impacted every single day as we do daily onboardings, greeting updates (holidays, outage, re-branding, etc)When we troubleshoot phone number routing and when greetings are incorrect, we need to navigate to the Talk admin centre. The loading issues are a major issue. And not being able to search for the impacted number requires navigating 24 separate pages to locate the number (the pages are going to continue going up and not down)WorkaroundsThere are no solutions we have found to make it easier to navigate or load fasterThe API isn't the best experience for us as it requires having the details in order to make any updates. We have 20+ admins that all make Talk changes, it would be unsustainable to keep a record. So we would have to make an API call to get an updated list every time we needed to make an update (many different API calls to get greetings, phone numbers, IVR setup, etc). Not to mention, make the information readable and processable into a format to make the necessary updates (this does not address the issue of being able to listen to the greetings to see if it is a mis-spelling of a greeting and then the wrong one was added to a number)What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function?Decrease loading times. Currently there are extreme loading delays. (10 seconds when flipping pages, 36 seconds to load greetings, 24 seconds when you click into a number to edit)Talk settings split up by Brand/Group rather than by instance wide (queue size, queue wait time, etc) as our teams have different needs and they don't align.Able to search for number, brand, unassigned numbers, nickname, groupAble to group numbers together for organization and easier navigation (like trigger categories)Ability to group greetings together for easier navigation (I would like to see all of the greetings associated with a certain group or brand)Ability to compare number setup without needing to scroll to find or duplicate tabs to compare (IVR comparison, Number settings - greeting comparison, etc)Transcript for greetings to allow us to read what each greeting is about without the need to listen to each greetingAbility to add notes/descriptions to greetings/numbers for future admins touching the setupAble to have holiday greetings. Right now we have to manually go in and change greetings for each number before a holiday begins (human error), and then go back to change it back (human error)Able to see revision history (ability to revert those changes ie. When a greeting is overwritten by accident)Ability to download greetings - there is a bug for windows and can only be downloaded via firefoxA better UI for greetingsAssign greetings to Brandsmake it searchable (so you can see all greetings with a certain name on a single page (rather than scrolling and ctrl+f)Ability to play greetings from inside the phone number settings (you can play it inside the VM greeting)Ability to search for greetings assigned to a numberEasy way to copy ZD phone number without needing to open/close the number (especially when you have it open and need to copy the number which makes it close and then you need to wait for it to reload again)A better method to see a list of groups in IVR and then clone the selectionsAbility to see when a greeting was updated/changedAbility to set an outage greeting and what behavior is to occur after it is played (easy to enable and disable, ability to continue routing or go to VM). This is important as it is only temporary to have it set up so it is a waste of time to manually change this to the outage greeting and then back. This is similar to the holiday greeting but we have a heads up with holidays. Outages are much more time sensitive and require faster responses. I had to do this yesterday for 15 phone numbers. And it took 5 hours (documentation of previous setup, loading time, upload new greetings, change greeting, turn off ivr so all calls go to VM, adjust triggers for routing)For routing tab inside editing a number, when there is group set up for routing, have the groups enabled for this number show at the top so we don't have to scroll to see which groups are enabled (could be one, could be many - there is human error if you miss one of the groups this number routes to)Within the ZD phone number editing page, you are unable to search for greetings when trying to apply them. Which means you have to scroll for the greetings (they are alphabetical but if you do not know the exact wording, you will have a tough time scrolling). So, it would be beneficial to be able to type and search for greetings when trying to apply them (like trigger conditions)Able to see what numbers are going to which group at first glance on a single page.Have the web URL reflect what page you were on (does not change when you are on page 24 vs. greetings). This would help documentation purposes and bookmarks for quick links.A way to demo the phone number set up without leaving the Talk Admin Centre (IVR routing, listening to the flow of greetings - similar to Chat in the settings page). The issue we run into is that to test the workflow, we would need Agents online/offline to ensure the setup is correct, and it results in a ticket being created. Especially if you need to test many IVR selections (imagine calling a number 10 times to listen to each IVR selection)",Feedback - Admin Center

It would be prevent downstream errors and reduce admin work time if filter criteria on triggers page could include 'unavailable'.Current: Without comprehensive knowledge of triggers and automations, this means that admin changes could mean a condition is no longer possible, rendering the rules less effective. In order to find unavailable trigger conditions, you need to open each individual trigger to review for errors. Applying filters can help narrow down the triggers affected by a known change, but without the granularity needed.Use cases:When a field or other asset is disabled/deleted, the condition/action is no longer available, but no errors are thrown. This means that there are downstream effects that may not be apparent, especially ones that don't have agent eyes on the expected behavior.Recently spun up a new sandbox so we could test a workflow involving 3 support emails. New sandboxes don't carry over the support emails from the email channel settings, and the email gets changed to a new subdomain - this means that the emails we'll be testing need to be recreated with the new subdomain. We have 51 triggers that include 'received at' conditions - the existing filter options can narrow it down from our 129 triggers to just the 51, but without knowing which ones rely on the 3 support emails, the admin needs to go through all 51 or cross-reference against live to identify which ones are impacted and need to be updated.Desired: Include 'unavailable' as an option in the filter drop downs so that admin can quickly identify conditions and actions that are no longer possible.",Feedback - Admin Center
