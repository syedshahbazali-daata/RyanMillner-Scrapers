We love hearing about how you use our tools and what would make them better. This guide is here to help you understand how the product feedback process works, and how to write an effective feedback post. You may also want to check out this short video on giving product feedback at Zendesk.This topic is for product feedback about the ticketing system. Don't worry, if your post should be in another topic, the Zendesk Community Team will move your post to the correct topic.Here are a few guidelines on how to use the Product Feedback topic, so that our Product team can effectively use and apply your feedback to our product planning process:Follow the Community Code of ConductFeedback and constructive criticism are welcome. Disparaging, harassing, mean, or snarky remarks about Zendesk, its employees, vendors, partners, or other community members will not be tolerated. We’re all friends and professionals, so let’s keep it polite. We don’t like having to remove comments, but we reserve the right to do so without warning in order to maintain a positive community experience for everyone.If it's a bug, contact supportThis topic is for sharing ideas about the product. If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions. We value all feedback and we're happy to have a place to engage in these conversations.",Feedback - Mobile Apps
Shawna James,Product Feedback + Feature Request Post Template,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6207882325786-Product-Feedback-Feature-Request-Post-Template,09/29/2023,"We have launched a new feedback form for your product feedback and feature requests. This format is meant to help our PM’s get the most information from you to better understand and log your requests. This format will be rolled out at the end of 2023 and will be enforced as a requirement for all new posts to be logged and/or responded to by product managers.Example:TITLE: Pizza Order ButtonPlease give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.]. (2-3 sentences)I would like to be able to order a pizza from my favorite restaurant directly by opening a Z2 ticket. This feature is currently affecting my agents because they are hungry and my customers because they are dealing with hungry and grumpy agents.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agent team is working late and they are hungry, but the ticket queue is too high for any of them to leave and get pizza. This button would allow for a quick click, confirmation, and order without having to leave your desk. Customizable order templates for each employee would also be amazing!When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This problem happens on a daily basis. This is critical for our business as our agents get very hungry which affects their productivity and our customer satisfaction score.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Yes, my agents have to manually order pizza on their phones using a third party app.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)I would like to see an option to order pizza in the upper right hand corner of my screen, represented by a pizza emoji which, when I click it, will take me directly to an order form for my nearest pizza shop. It would be great if the system could remember my previous order and use that data to speed up the ordering process.",Feedback - Mobile Apps
Jason Ray,Bug in IOS App - Macros,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6350802588826-Bug-in-IOS-App-Macros,11/06/2023,"When in a messaging conversation, trying to apply a macro to the conversation causes the app to lock up about half of the time. I can apply the macros successfully when I am doing an email response or internal note, but a messaging response seems to cause the failure.",Feedback - Mobile Apps

I am currently having to set the status via the APIs because the mobile app isn't working.This prevents us from being able to use the mobile apps to properly monitoring the live chat messaging.",Feedback - Mobile Apps
WhatsApp Connector,Visualising Additional Comments to Previous Comments in the Zendesk Support App,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6331081401754-Visualising-Additional-Comments-to-Previous-Comments-in-the-Zendesk-Support-App,11/01/2023,"We would like to be able to see additional comments that are done to previous comments in the mobile app. On the web browser it works well:But it is not the case in the mobile app:Certain customers of us work a lot in the mobile app and this is a constraint for certain tickets because they cannot continue with the ticket resolution from them when the end users make updates on previous comments.There are no workarounds for this since, as commented, they use the mobile app every day and the only way to see those updates is on their web browsers.Ideally, additional comments on previous comments should be visualised in the Zendesk Support Mobile App similarly to the first screenshot.Thanks.",Feedback - Mobile Apps
Kristen Koehler,Shortcuts Needed in Mobile App,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/5988286860442-Shortcuts-Needed-in-Mobile-App,08/01/2023,"I am using the ZenDesk app on an iPhone14 and the /shortcuts I use to answer customers in chat are not available. This is a HUGE pain because if I'm using the app it means I'm away from my desk and on the go, typically after work hours, and being able to answer quickly but with detail is important. The shortcuts are arguably MORE important on mobile. We are a small start-up so don't have a staff of round-the-clock customer service folks. Being able to quickly handle chats during non-business hours is important to us. Not sure why they aren't supported in the mobile app and if anyone else is experiencing anything similar.",Feedback - Mobile Apps
