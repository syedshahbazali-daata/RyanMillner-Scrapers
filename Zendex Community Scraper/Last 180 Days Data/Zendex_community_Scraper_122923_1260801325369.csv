Shawna James,Product feedback guidelines & how to write a good feedback post,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6207767532442-Product-feedback-guidelines-how-to-write-a-good-feedback-post,09/29/2023,"Welcome to the Product Feedback Topic for Zendesk's Ticketing System (Support)!No one knows our products better than you, our users. We love hearing about how you use our tools and what would make them better. This guide is here to help you understand how the product feedback process works, and how to write an effective feedback post. You may also want to check out this short video on giving product feedback at Zendesk.This topic is for product feedback about the ticketing system. Don't worry, if your post should be in another topic, the Zendesk Community Team will move your post to the correct topic.Here are a few guidelines on how to use the Product Feedback topic, so that our Product team can effectively use and apply your feedback to our product planning process:Follow the Community Code of ConductFeedback and constructive criticism are welcome. Disparaging, harassing, mean, or snarky remarks about Zendesk, its employees, vendors, partners, or other community members will not be tolerated. We’re all friends and professionals, so let’s keep it polite. We don’t like having to remove comments, but we reserve the right to do so without warning in order to maintain a positive community experience for everyone.If it's a bug, contact supportThis topic is for sharing ideas about the product. If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions. We value all feedback and we're happy to have a place to engage in these conversations.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

This format is meant to help our PM’s get the most information from you to better understand and log your requests. This format will be rolled out at the end of 2023 and will be enforced as a requirement for all new posts to be logged and/or responded to by product managers.Example:TITLE: Pizza Order ButtonPlease give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.]. (2-3 sentences)I would like to be able to order a pizza from my favorite restaurant directly by opening a Z2 ticket. This feature is currently affecting my agents because they are hungry and my customers because they are dealing with hungry and grumpy agents.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agent team is working late and they are hungry, but the ticket queue is too high for any of them to leave and get pizza. This button would allow for a quick click, confirmation, and order without having to leave your desk. Customizable order templates for each employee would also be amazing!When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This problem happens on a daily basis. This is critical for our business as our agents get very hungry which affects their productivity and our customer satisfaction score.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Yes, my agents have to manually order pizza on their phones using a third party app.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)I would like to see an option to order pizza in the upper right hand corner of my screen, represented by a pizza emoji which, when I click it, will take me directly to an order form for my nearest pizza shop.

(2-3 sentences)In regards to the Ticket statistics section, can the numbers be hyperlinked to the appropriate survey tickets? This affects all agents.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)The new Agent home still has the number count, but no longer hyperlinks to tickets so can't view the surveyed tickets any longer. The old dashboard used to have the number count for Good and Bad, in which you could click and it would then show the list of tickets.When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This problem occurs everyday. This is not a major impact to our business, but would be very helpful for our agents to view their Good and Bad ticket statistics to boost moral (Good) or use feedback to improve an agent's workflow (Bad).Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Yes. This was previously available (and technically still is) via the old agent dashboard - https://drfirsthelp.zendesk.com/agent/dashboard?show=v1What would be your ideal solution to this problem?

This affects IT that isn't able to test an app or configuration in a non-production environmentWhat problem do you see this solving?

(2-3 sentences)I want to be able to send some attachments as ""secure"" and others normally. Currently, it is an all-or-nothing global setting. This affects agents and customers. Agents cannot attach non-sensitive helpful inline screenshots, for example. Also, customers must sign in unnecessarily for non-sensitive attachments. Customers also miss attachments often because they are not embedded into the email. However, we still need secure attachments as we do occasionally send sensitive data.What problem do you see this solving?

There's a button in the resource centre that basically says ""launch chat.""

So there is no verified Zendesk account in any case.It's also not possible to verify them manually, since requests will come in from new email addresses all the time.There should be an option in the organization setting to also accept users that are unverified.We need to act swiftly and different to certain agencies or companies, which is currently impossible.That should be a small fix for Zendesk but given the years Zendesk needed to even implement highly demanded requests like the raise of visible views, maybe someone else found a workaround for this.

This option should enable the user to clarify several questions while the bot is open.Our bot tree is configured in such a way that the user is asked at the end of the tree whether his problem could be solved or not. He is then given the opportunity to create a ticket, after which the survey ends.This problem occurs several times a day because the user either has several questions immediately or leaves the tab open in which the bot is open and then has another question later. Customers who are new to our software are affected by this. It is important to us that new customers have a positive user experience so that we don't lose them.Currently, the user must close and reopen the tab in which the bot is active if he has several questions (which is the only option I've found). That seems a bit too complicated and is not very intuitive.We would like to have an additional element in the Bot Builder that allows me to jump to a selectable point in the tree structure.

It is expected that dropdown options wouldn't automatically populate if you have over 100 organizations in your account.We have thousands of organizations as we are a large enterprise company, and so far, I felt that Zendesk is a good solution for a company of our size. Now, I am less sure. I understand the need to limit the number of options populated in a dropdown, but 100 is a very low number. I think that the Zendesk product/dev team did not think this through and just came up with an arbitrary number that does not fit users' needs.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

If the email address is inserted as a ""mail to"" link then the above line is NOT removed from the ticket. I believe this is a bug. The line should be removed either way. The issue is that Outlook seems to render an email address as a link even when the link attribute is explicitly removed.2) If the nominated requester's email address is not found in the customer database then a new customer is added with the name set as the username section of the nominated email. In the above case, the requester's name would be set to ""john.doe"". This is unsightly and looks unprofessional. It can be changed via the support portal. However, it would be an improvement if a name in addition to an email address could be defined in the #requester tag.

Automated email(s) sent to a requester/cc from an automation or trigger are not visible communications on a ticket.For example - there are out-of-the-box triggers for ""Notify requester of received ticket"" which emails the requester of a ticket a generic message (i.e. Your request has been received, here is your ticket number XYZ).This same feature is used in other contexts for specific operations or ticket-types - if a specific tag is on a ticket for instance or type of question has been submitted, there are cases where an automation or trigger is designed to send a generic email to the requester / cc's with specific information related to the ticket (i.e. Thank you for request about XYZ topic - our team is looking into this. In the meantime, here are resources to help you with XYZ topic you submitted) as a buffer until an agent is able to physically send a manual first-reply on the ticket.Solution:Agents would find it useful thatany automation or trigger sending an outbound email to a requester / ccshould be visible in the Zendesk ticket for reference. This lack of visibility can be difficult for agents not to know when certain communications go out to customers automatically and do not have the ability to actually view the automation/trigger email sent as a non-admin of the system. The ""Event logs"" might show that an automation or trigger sent an email to a requester / cc - but this email record is not visible for agent(s) to see on the ticket.Can Zendesk implement a function to allow when an automation and/or trigger sends an automated reply or notification to a requester / cc - make this visible on the ticket or ticket history panel in agent workspace as a visible message / or internal note of the automated message that sent to the customer?",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

This means that there is no need to select an option to make an internal comment, because you would be able to use the other column.Example:Reason:Many agents working in Zendesk have to create multiple internal comments and external communications on the same ticket. In many cases we need to alternate many hundreds of times a year. Inevitably there will be some human error in mistakenly forgetting to select ""internal"" and sending a potentially sensitive email to the customer.I guarantee if I had the option to keep all internal threads vertically isolated from external threads, it would be far more intuitive for me to ensure the communication goes to the correct person. This would reduce the chances of human error coming into play as no separate action needs to be taken, we would simply be replying in the same area where the previous communication came from. It would be fundamentally counter-intuitive for me to send a reply to an internal comment to an external customer.Humans will make mistakes and in some very sensitive situations the existing functionality I believe does not prevent human error sufficiently. At least I should have the option to fully isolate internal vs external communications in different sections of the UI.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

You would need to deactivate the status and create it again under the new categoryReporting: You cannot report on how long a ticket status has been in a state natively.There is a workaround with triggers adding tagsCharacter limit: There’s a 48 character limit for ticket status names. Ticket status names that are 35 characters or longer are truncated. We can't set how that looks visuallySolved/Closed category: Solved and Closed tickets are both under the Ticket Category of Solved which can be confusing for Agents that have views set up to look at solved and closed ticketsEntire ticket status visible in views: The entire Ticket Status becomes visible which means lengthy statuses can expand views into a scrollbarScrolling in statuses: If you have more than 10 active ticket statuses, the status picker will display the first 10 active ticket statuses. Agents will need to scroll down to see the restStatus deletion: You cannot delete a ticket status once it is createdAny tickets using the deactivated ticket status will still retain the statusNew Status: You cannot assign a Custom Status under the 'New' status categoryHide statuses: You can't hide statuses but still use them similar to New and Closed statusesWhat problem do you see this solving?More customization options, less confusion, less adjustment period, easier management of ticket statuses, better reporting - our jobs should not get harder with new featuresWhen was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business?We have not turned on statuses yet but we are going through testingAutomatic changes: We would need to do extensive information gathering to see exactly what is being changed (wording, triggers, etc) as we document a lot of processes and we would not want the data to be outdated when it comes to turning this onVisibility: We have multiple teams that have different needs and having to collaborate with them to agree on what statuses we have will not work. We would rather make no changes than make a change that will impact everyone (this impacts reporting which has high visibility)Reordering: Teams change their mind all the time on locations and having the statuses locked in on first go is very unlikely. We might find that it is hard to read or it doesn't make sense visually and so our options are to deactivate the status and recreate itCustomization: Our teams may want to have several Open types as many things could be happening on the ticket and if they are all the same color, they could click on the wrong ones which impacts reportingMove between categories: I can't see this happening too often but when it does, there may be tickets already assigned to the category so you need to deactivate, create new, then move tickets to the category (as long as not closed)Reporting: Teams are already asking about ticket history for the status and we are needing to get a list of statuses we want then start creating triggers just for the tags to be addedSolved/Closed category: When we turned this on in our sandbox, the very first question is how they can tell the difference between solved/closed. As such, we need to teach a fundamental change of how views will look going forward. Which means different processes/view updatesEntire ticket status visible in views: The visual appearance of views is already a lot of information and now to add entire statuses makes the views a lot more noisy. We have gotten complaints as views now have scrollbars due to length of statusScrolling in statuses: We are setting internal limits on how many statuses we have so we don't hit that scrollbarStatus deletion: Already made a mistake in adding in statuses as part of test - they will remain there until the end of timeNew status: I would like to be able to set different types of 'New' statuses. Like when it is a New ticket due to a follow up being created vrs a brand new interactionHide statuses: There are some statuses that we do not want Agents to be able to set. For example, when a ticket reopens due to being onhold, they shouldn't be able to set the ticket to be ""Open - due date"", instead a trigger should do it (like setting tickets to closed)Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain)There are no workarounds for the majority of the limitations - as such we are delaying turning on Custom tickets statuses until the last moment so that most of these can hopefully be addresses by then.Restrict by Brand/Group - on roadmapReporting on how long statuses - have to create triggers for each status and report on tags and not status (requires you to do this upon conception and to maintain the statuses/triggers)Status deletion - you can deactivate the statusReordering statuses/move status between categories - you have to deactivate a status or statuses then recreate it in the order you wantWhat would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function?Automatic changes: When enabled/disabled Custom Ticket Statuses automatically updates triggers/automations/macros/views. Have it display what triggers/views etc were adjusted. It would be even better if it was a spreadsheet that we can export to keep track of all changes made. Even for any articles with screenshots of previous views/statuses, we can replace those in articlesVisibility: Ability to set a Brand/group/form for each status (like contextual workspaces) so if it meets that condition, it will be displayedGroup/Brand based statuses are on roadmapReordering: Ability to drag and drop the status or have an option to 'select position' similar to how triggers used to be able to be rearrangedCustomization/Entire ticket status visible in views: Within the status, you can change the colors like you can font or include an icon.Previously, statuses were identified as N, O, P, H, S, C within a view - it would be nice to have the ability to set abbreviations or icons to help reduce the clutter/noise in a viewMove between categories: Similar to changing the order of the triggers, you can also move the triggers to a different category. Similar to Trigger CategoriesReporting: Within Explore, you can look at ticket history to see exactly how long a ticket was in certain statuses, who updated the status, and what statuses the ticket was inCharacter limit: I understand there needing to be a character limit but rather than forcing a truncation, having the ability to set how the status appears (appears on multiple lines, cuts off at this word, etc)Solved/Closed category: Having Closed be its own category so we can easily tell which ticket is closed and solved rather than looking at the bucket beside the subject - less visual confusionScrolling in statuses: I understand that having all statuses visible would be rather large and eventually it would need to scroll. However, if there was the ability to set nested statuses, this could reduce the need for scrolling. Or the ability to set if you want statuses to scroll or minimize the textStatus deletion: You should be able to delete a status. And if there are tickets associated with the status, then we should be able to set what status the tickets should be changed to OR have it retained by deactivating the statusNew statuses: Ability to add other options for New statuses for easier visibilityHide statuses: Ability to hide statuses but triggers can still action on them (like New, and Closed).

Similarly, Users in XYZbelong toPartner One-XYZ.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)It would be very helpful if we could set visibility rules for tickets by tags at an organization level, instead of having to create duplicates. For example:ABC - add tag:abc at an organization level so all tickets have itXYZ - add tag:xyz at an organization level so all tickets have itPartner OnePartner TwoJust like in the Organization you can determine if a user can view their own tickets or all organization tickets, there could be another optional rule where users in this organization can only view tickets with its tags.In this example, users in ABC are also in Partner One and Partner Two organizations but can only view tickets with tag abc, where the tag is added to the ticket through a field in the ticket form or a trigger.Users in XYZ are also in Partner One organization but can only view tickets with tag xyz, where the tag is added to the ticket through a field in the ticket form or a trigger.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

We want to handle the requests by SLA first, but we also need to consider tickets that has no SLA set. In Zendesk SLAs are often based on comments, and some tickets have a SLA met but are still Open or new, and should be handled.We want to have better logic in place to e.g. weight on SLA first, but also consider the tickets that are new/open and based on for example their request date or custom date field, rank them higher. Today we'd have to use akward automations to update the data of these tickets. I wish we could have a better view defintion such as multiple sorting criteria or a sort expression, weighing different parameters to build the final View order.Use caseWe have process like two-party signing processes, where tickets are created in Zendesk early, but they don't need action from support until both parties has signed an agreement. We have these tickets in a View sorted on the Signed date. However, the same business functions also gets follow up requests and direct requests that are not part of the signing process. We have a hard time to build a view that properly balance the request order between these two different processes, because the View only supports a single sort order. Again, dealing with Automations or Triggers to try to build some data based on customer actions and build a view based off on that, makes things quite complicated.Make it simplerWe'd like improved capabilites in Zendesk Support to better determine the order in which our agents process tickets. The current capabilities are that we have two options:Group by (e.g. priority)Sort by (an attribute)These are not enough for us. Due to how SLAs, agent reassignments, customer updates, custom dates from custom processes work, etc, we find ourselves limited in arranging an effective request order pipeline.This becomes even more important if we were to start working with a push model.The situation that we typically find ourselves in is that we find a sort order that works for 80-95% of the tickets, and then we have situations where the simple sort order rules we can have in Views are not enough, and the requests risk a bad customer experience because they are at the end of a view, or somewhere in the middle, when they should be next in line.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

The same goes if you add images to macros and use them as Messaging replies.

Sydney Neubauer,Side Conversation Limitations,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6245545265946-Side-Conversation-Limitations,10/11/2023,"Overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.].Side Conversations are a fundamental function among our teams. We all use Side Conversations to communicate to third parties (email) and among teams (child tickets) every day and almost on every ticket (we get 9000+tickets a day)Unfortunately, there are more limitations we are experiencing by continuing to use Side Conversations which: slows down our team (time equals money), causes lost communication (possible legal complications), frustration, lost visibility, reduced faith in processes, reduced reliability, and not a good user experienceIntegral core functions that are missing:Change in Assignee/Updater: If you are not part of the child ticket (didn't initiate it) and you do not have access to the group it was started with, you CANNOT continue the conversation. Someone needs to add you to the Child ticket as a CC/Follower (easier said than done as you cannot see the ticket ID that you need to be added to)Visibility: If you are not part of the Child ticket, you cannot see the Status of the child ticket, the Group it is assigned to, or the Ticket ID that is created. Which means that you can't tell when you don't have access to the child ticket vs. when the Child ticket is ClosedPrivate Group Child ticket: There was recently a launch for Private groups which restricts access to Private Groups even if you submitted the request. This also applies to Child tickets. Which means even the requester CANNOT update their own Child ticket that they createdParent ticket follow-up: When a child ticket closes, you cannot update the Child ticket anymore (this is new functionality) to help ensure conversations were not lost as there were no follow ups being created for child tickets. However, this does not apply when the PARENT ticket closes. As such, a child ticket can respond to the parent ticket, but it does not provide any update on the parent ticket. And there is no indication on the child ticket that the conversation is closed (you can click on link but only if you have access to ticket). And there is no follow up ticket created for the parent ticket eitherFeature requests:These suggestions are to just bring Side Conversations up to par with regular ticket interactions.Grids/tables: Ability to use grids/tables within Side Conversations. We have macros that use templates to be filled in for teams, but it cannot be copied, pasted or added via macro.Text editing capabilities: Additional text editing capabilities (colors, formatting, etc.). Same as the current ticket text editorPrint/export Side Conversations: Ability to print/export Side Conversations. Right now, there are no solutions for being able to export a Side Conversation and our teams need to sometimes be able to include a conversation in another ticket as an attachment.Amount of Child tickets: There is a limit of 50 child tickets in one ticket. This prevents the use of certain workflows (communication to agents, bulk notifications, etc.)Signature formatting/Simplified threading: There can be a rather lengthy thread and repeat signatures/previous replies all extend the conversation. Tickets can have a minimize option so it would be nice to include that for Side Conversations to make them easier to read.Internal notes: Side Conversations can get long so you end up needing to read the entire conversation over again (imagine having 5 SC to read and the ticket exchanging assignees).What problem do you see this solving?Core functionality: Right now, it is the expectation that when you talk with other teams, they always get your messages, and that assignee can handle a ticket to 100% of their ability without loss of access. This is not the case so when it happens, it causes backlogs, support tickets, investigations, informing, training, meetings, new workflows, etc. Side Conversations should make our lives easier and not harder.New features: These would bring Side Conversations back up to being on par with ticket functionality (they aren't new features but new to Side Conversations).Goal: A seamless conversation among groups where access and functionality are not lostWhen was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business?I get questions daily about side Conversations and the missing functionality or the behavior limitation.Impact:Change in Assignee/Updater: I currently have 5 tickets about that as the original assignee went on vacation and handed over tickets to other team members. They are unable to update the Child tickets that were started by the original Assignee. I had to create an article, create a reminder communication among the team (not the first time), provide training, add the new assignees as followers, inform managers, etc.Visibility: I get at least one ticket a day asking why they can't update a Child ticket, only to find out the ticket is Closed (even if it wasn't, they couldn't update it due to the access limitation).Private Group Child ticket: We got about 12 tickets when this first rolled out due to the limitation that even requesters could not update their Child tickets for a private group (we only have 3 private groups but are wanting to add more). This resulted in an escalation, a Zendesk ticket for investigation, a review of Private groups and Roles.Parent ticket follow-up: There is a ticket for this a week regarding why a response from a child ticket did not inform the assignee of the parent ticket. A ZD ticket was created for investigation, a review of workflows.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem?Core Features:Change in Assignee/Updater: You have to submit a ticket to IT and then they will add the new Assignee to the Child ticket as a CC/follower to allow them access (this has to be done every time the Assignee changes).Visibility: We had to create a webhook that will add the ticket ID and group it is assigned to as a public comment, so it shows on the Parent ticket for visibility. We are going to need to create another for when status changed to Closed.Private Group Child ticket: We had to request to be excluded from this feature update as you cannot reverse a Group from being a Private group and we did not want to grant all ticket access or group access.Parent ticket follow-up: we are looking into a workflow that will close the child ticket when the parent ticket closes.Feature requests:Grids/tables: The team applies a macro to an internal note with the template, the agent fills in the details and then submits the comment. Then they use another macro to start the Child ticket and they chose the function of copy comments from the parent ticket so it can be included (better hope there are no typos).Text editing capabilities: NonePrint/export Side Conversations: None - we can use API, but this is not widely known or used as it is not typical Agent functionality, only admins.Amount of Child tickets: A new ticket needs to be created to complete the tasks.Signature formatting/Simplified threading: NoneInternal note: To summarize a side conversation, you can add an internal note within the parent ticket but it gets very messy very fast if you have more than one ongoing SC.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function?Core Features:Change in Assignee/Updater: If you have access to the parent ticket, you should be able to access and edit the Child ticket.Visibility: No matter the access of the Agent, they should be able to tell who the Child ticket was created for (Group), the Ticket ID, and the status of the Child ticketPrivate Group Child ticket: It should not matter if it be a Private or a Public Child ticket, it should still be able to be updated if you are accessing it from within a parent ticket.Parent ticket follow-up: Either the parent ticket needs a follow up ticket created for when an update is made from child ticket, or the child ticket needs to close so it can't be edited (it would then mirror the functionality of when a child ticket closes).Feature requests:Grids/tables: A grid/table can be pasted/created/edited within a new side conversation (any type of Side Conversation)Text editing capabilities: Text editor toolbar that is present in tickets is visible and usable within Side ConversationsPrint/export Side Conversations: You can choose to export or print the entire Side Conversation (any type of Side Conversation)Amount of Child tickets: The removal of the limit for how many Side Conversations can be created.Signature formatting/Simplified threading: Just like in current ticket functionality, Agent signatures are added on the backend (tickets add them via triggers), there is simplified threading to reduce the amount of duplicate text shown.Internal note: It functions same as in tickets so you can add an internal note within any of the Side Conversations started (a summary, next steps, etc) so that it is easy for the next Agent to pick up (or help refresh yourself on what to do next).Related feedback posts (thank you everyone!)Ability to update child ticket if you have access to parent ticketTables/GridsPrint Side ConversationsExporting Side ConversationsSide Conversation 50 limitSide Conversation signature formatting",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

One innocuous one is e.g. the 'Turn on emoji text replacement' setting. Other examples include the recent 'Improved views experience' (you can choose whether to limit the visible views or not)... or the contentious 'can we switch the order of replies on tickets' (maybe in the future we can pick between top down or bottom up).The issue here is that when these options are released, they're nearly all at the company-wide level (some are role based). This forces admins to be the decider, immediately making 50% of the company (or role) happy and 50% of them unhappy - because these are all such personal settings. One person wants emoji text replacement on because it makes it easy to pick emojis. Another person hates the feature because they are using code with `:` characters all the time, and it drives them mad. Trying to please everyone is literally impossible.Are there plans to move these types of 'personal experience' setting out from company-wide admin settings, into agent profile configuration/preferences in the future please? Let the agent who prefers to see more views, see more views. Let the agent who prefers to see on the most important shared views, and easily see their personal views, switch it off.

One team may solve 15 tickets per person per day, while a more technical team may solve 1-2 tickets per person per day. For lower volume teams, the Skill wait time needs to be able to be longer, but we currently have a single, global wait time setting.

Currently, there’s no way to link a list with another list and this means having a single secondary list which is very long in order to cover every option in the primary list.In our support process agents have to choose values in 2 form fields that exist in a 2 level space (think ‘category’ and its related ‘close code’).

This is because each ticket needs to have both form fields filled out but it is currently very easy for agents to submit a wrong combination as there’s no input validation available either.We have a (very poor) workaround in place: duplicating the label from the primary field into the secondary level, thus making the possibility of mismatched categories even worse.The ideal solution would be something like this: for each item in a list, allow an administrator to designate a related list of options that will show in a secondary list when the primary option is chosen.eg:choose A in the first list, options 1,2,3 show up in the 2nd list. choose B in the first list, options 4,5,6 show up in the 2nd list.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

In short, a domain (synced from a SFDC account) ends up being mapped to an org in ZD which it should not be, and subsequently users with this domain are also incorrectly associated with it. The error ultimately is on the person that does this on the SFDC end, but this is less in our control in Support and this sometimes happens by mistake.A brief example is sometimes a ""gmail.com"" domain is erroneously added to a SFDC account, this then ends up syncing to the ZD org and ultimately every single user with a gmail.com address being associated with this one company in ZD.Whilst we can obviously fix this in SFDC, it would be ideal if we would be able to search for organizations in ZD by what domain is entered so that we could locate affected orgs and remove the domain from them on the ZD side to speed up the fix. I can't believe this isn't possible already - however I contacted support and it was confirmed to me that searching by domain names is currently not supported. The domain field is also not categorized as a custom field, and ZD documentation does not specify domain names as a searchable attribute:https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408886879258#topic_gok_ffv_ucHoping that this would be a very easy feature to implement and that others would find this useful too!",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

Most use a macro today to fill in the form automatically and maybe even have a template for comment and subject. It would be nice to save the extra few clicks of updating select an address to be able to have the macro select it for them.2.

Currently, the SLA breach conditions are handled the same regardless of which target is breached (First Reply Time, Total Resolution Time, etc).Description/Use Cases:We are trying to set up escalations for certain types of tickets based on our SLA Targets. The agent assigned to the ticket will receive a notification when the SLA is breached. If a certain amount of time passes after the breach without a resolution, we want a notification sent to management. If further time passes, we want a notification sent to senior management (see table below).We would like the time between escalation levels to be dependent on the SLA Target. However, the current ""Hours since last SLA breach"" condition in automations does not take into account which SLA target is breached. This means we can only set one time period for each escalation level regardless of which SLA target is breached. In our case, it does not make sense to set one time period to escalate a ticket for First Reply Time, Periodic Update, and Total Resolution Time.Business impact of limitation or missing feature:We can likely use additional automation conditions to work around this limitation for the specific SLA targets we have chosen. However, they will not measure exactly the same way, and they will be harder to maintain. If we decide to change the times on any of the SLA targets (level 1), we would have to update all of the additional automations as well.In addition, we would not be able to work around this at all if we used any of the SLA targets which pause for a particular status.

From what zendesk support says there is no way to do what we require.It would be nice if we could have an allow list connected to the suspended ticket setting that states anything coming from one of the listed domains doesn't get suspended and anything else can be.We also use exchange to do some of our filters on our own so it would even be nice if this option could be turned off.If anyone has a work around for this It would be appreciated but ultimately it would be better if zendesk had more setting options for this area.,Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

The current options are restrictive and do not cover all requirements for Automations.Observed problem:Currently in Automations there are multiple ""hours since"" time contingent conditions including ""hours since assignee update"", ""hours since requester update"", and ""hours since update""; however, there are no options for ""hours since an agent update"", ""hours since an agent public reply"", or ""hours since an end user update"" which are necessary for some use cases.Example use case:Say a team has an operation structure where multiple Agents may respond to a ticket including or in addition to the ticket Assignee. Now say that leadership wishes for tickets to be escalated that have not been responded by any Agent in 24 hours.If an Automation solution was built with the existing option of ""hours since Assignee update"" then it would only be considering the updates of the Assignee, not the updates of peer Agents. Therefore, if another Agent steps in to assist the Requester it would not be recognized by the Automation, and therefore would be escalated.The alternative existing option, ""hours since update"", also has challenges. If this option is used, then any update will ""reset the clock"" of the Automation - including minor updates outside a Public Reply, or, even worse, Requester updates; the reason Requester updates could be considered problematic is that if a Requester becomes agitated on the lack of response and replies ""why haven't you answered me yet?"" it would be recognized as an update and therefore the ticket would not be escalated due to no response, which could compound the issue.This could be solved if we had the ability to either use ""hours since Agent update"" or ""hours since Agent Public Reply"" - the latter being the most useful for this particular use case example.Ideal Solution:Please add additional Automation conditions such as:hours since Agent updatehours since End-User updatehours since Agent Public Replyhours since End User Public Replyhours since Requester Public Reply",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

For example: The assignee of the ticket can always update the child tickets associated with their ticket.Description/Use Cases:We have many teams that work in our instance and they communicate to other teams across divisions (escalations, managers, permissions, entitlements, HR, etc).There may be a legal issue presented in a ticket so they will reach out to HR. However the original assignee goes on vacation so they hand over their current ticket load to another Agent. That Agent needs to be able to continue the conversation with HR without the need of additional steps to do so.Business impact of limitation or missing feature:Right now, if the role of the assignee is tied to only being able to access tickets you are in the group of, and a Child ticket was created for a group that you do not have access to:You CANNOT edit the child ticket from the parent ticketYou CANNOT access the child ticket directlyYou cannot see the status of the child ticket - this is a rather big issue as you cannot update a closed child ticket but it looks the exact same as when you don't have access. So you don't know when it is a permission limitation or the conversation is closedYou cannot see the ticket ID associated with the child ticketYou cannot see which group the child ticket is associated forChild tickets are treated like any other ticket - if you do not have access to the ticket normally, you cannot edit. The idea behind it is so that other users cannot access a potentially private conversation. However, someone that does not have access to update the ticket, can still read the conversation from the parent ticket so it does not make sense as to why they cannot continue the conversation, since assignees change all the time.The workarounds are:Grant them access to the entire group (the purpose of child tickets is so that they only access tickets that are relevant to their assigned ticket)Change their role to have access to all tickets (this would give them way too much access - and they would need to include private groups which defeats the purpose)Have someone on the Child ticket add the new assignee as a follower or change the requester (manual process, creates a bottleneck, loss of efficiency) - but because you cannot see what group the child ticket is for, you aren't even sure who to reach out toIf you have access to the Child ticket, you will be able to see the status of the ticket, group, ID. And you can make updates to the conversation in any status but closedIf you do not have access, you will not be able to see the ticket ID, status, assigned group, and you can't update the ticket regardless of status.

We manage a restricted Zendesk space - need a sign in for access.- # of users/users who validated their emails - and did not- # of users/users who actually signed in - and who has not signed inWe wanted this not only in dashboard widgets but in actionable outputs so we could then communicate to those who did not respond; resend their sign up link, remind them to take action etc.Business impact of limitation or missing feature:If you don't know who isn't signing in/validating you can't send them reminders.

We have a second picklist field called ""Resolution"" that has a long list of resolutions (i.e. 1-20).Since many resolutions are specific to certain categories, the Zendesk admin should be able to set conditions to display certain picklist values based on what is selected in the ""Category"" picklist.For example, if category ""A"" is selected, only resolutions 1 - 5 are selectable. If category ""B"" is selected, only resolutions 5, 6 and 10 are selectable. And so on.

Get Started messages, FAQs, reactions, message bumps. This is such a big problem. Many people just send the get started message and wait for a response, but this never creates a ticket!- Random periods of high latency where it can take minutes to create the initial ticket.- Outages- Weird, unexpected behavior like bot responses saying, ""We cannot connect right now: Start Over,"" despite no bot being connected to the channels.Is anyone else experiencing these issues?

The initial notification is sent from here. Future replies are sent from here. The easiest way to change it is by using the ""Select an Address"" app, but this requires manual user input. You can limit which emails replies are sent from through the app, but if you limit the incoming address Zendesk reverts to the default address, when I want emails to be sent from a particular address.My use case:We set up an email address in our system, tested it, everything seemed good. We advertised the address. Then some issues arose with the address, and the only way out is to change to a new address. The new address is now set as the primary email for that email account, but the To header remains the same through the mail flow, and Zendesk still uses it as the recipient.To headers cannot be modified in transit beyond completely deleting the To header, which means emails addressed to multiple people would lose recipients. A ""recieve and deliver"" forwarding method would destroy customer information.We need to retain the address for incoming emails, but we don't want to use it to send things back out.We can remove the old address as a support address, and the recipient field is set correctly, but if something is directed to the old address, the old address is set as a CC to the email which looks confusing.The current workaround:We're using webhooks to alter the ""recipient"" on arrival. This does have some shortcomings, mainly in extra triggers are required to send notifications, and if the webhook fails no notification email will be sent. We'll just have to monitor all incoming email in the meantime.A permanent fix:Let us set the ""recipient"" field in triggers! This would have allowed the most minor of adjustments to achieve a problem free outcome.

One oddity that we found is that the link in the welcome email that is sent out is good one time only. If for any reason, the customer clicks that link and then doesn't sign up, if they click it again it takes them to the ""Zendesk user change your password"" screen which is the wrong place. Zendesk support says it is working as expected but it is confusing to our customers. There are 2 cases we have seen this. The first is if the customer has an issue signing up the first time or doesn't finish and then tries again later. The other is that customers forget the link to our support system and try to use this link to go back to it. In both cases, when they click it they end up on a screen that isn't relevant and suggests they can change their password which if they do, does nothing because we do not use Zendesk security. |We have added tips in the email and in our online guide, but that's not really effective since people don't read those details...Looking for tips from others that might have gone down this path.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

However, we did encounter one issue where tickets were being assigned to agents in different time zones who were not online. To address this, we quickly developed a script to set all agents to offline. It would have been helpful if this feature was built into the Omnichannel Routing settings. We struggled for about an hour with Zendesk Support before I found documentation from Zendesk suggesting that we either ask all agents to set themselves to offline (which is not feasible for a global company), or use an API call to set all agent statuses to offline.Aside from this issue, we have some feedback that we would like to share to help improve the functionality of Omnichannel Routing.Individual Capacity Rules for AgentsWe have received feedback from agents requesting more personalized capacity rules for ticket management. At times, the default group's capacity rules are too high for them and they would prefer to accept fewer tickets. While we could create a new group for these agents, this would result in an excessive number of groups, rather than managing capacity rules within the capacity rules UI.Buffer Time Before Assigning Tickets to AgentsOur agents are currently receiving a high volume of tickets at once, sometimes up to 5-7 tickets when they set themselves to online. This can be overwhelming for the agent, and they have suggested that there be a buffer in place for ticket distribution to ensure a more equal distribution when another agent comes online. One solution could be to lower the agent's capacity to handle fewer tickets. Another suggestion is to implement a timer that prevents the assignment of new tickets for 5-10 minutes after an agent has been assigned a ticket. This will allow the agent to focus on the current ticket before receiving another one.Waterfall Email TicketsWe have created a Workato recipe that regularly checks all open tickets every 10 minutes. If an agent assigned to a ticket is marked as ""Away"" or ""Offline"" within the last 10 minutes, the ticket is reassigned to the main group assigned by Omnichannel Routing. This is particularly important for tickets received through email, as assigning a ticket to an agent who is away from their computer or at the end of their workday can cause the ticket to go unattended.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

In the WhatsApp chatbot I built for my company, I included various article links created using Zendesk Guide within each text box that made sense to the customer's needs at that moment. So, if a customer needs to reset their login password, they can access one of the ""Password Reset"" buttons, and the bot will send an article from the Guide explaining how to reset the password. The customer can then finish the interaction by clicking the ""End Interaction"" button. However, when I try to track which articles are resolving the most tickets, I'm unable to do so because the ""End Interaction"" button has the same name for all the interactions after sending and receiving the article.

If in an automation one could say ""if X number of (calendar)/(business) hours before due date"" then ""reopen at X time on due date""Understandably automations do not run continuously so an exact minute may be difficult.

We want to send that from our primary support email (support@mydomain.org) so that any replies will be delivered to Zendesk. But we'd also like to copy zendesk with a CC copy of that original email so that we have a ticket in Zendesk to track the communication, particularly so that we can follow up if we get no response).Unfortunately, at the moment, because that initial email has a reply address of the primary support address, the ticket is suspended. This means that today we simply do not include support@mydomain.com as a cc address; if the user replies, we get a ticket, but we need to track this communication separately to cover the case that the user does NOT reply and needs followup. And of course having separate systems to track follow-ups is less than ideal!My proposal - if the domain of the support address is included on the white-list of allowed domains and addresses, this would override the suspension of messages from the support address. Or perhaps we could be a bit more specific, if the individual email for the support address is in the white-list, this bypasses the suspension.Less desirable alternative: if there was some keyword that we could place into the message that would tell the code determining whether to suspend the ticket that this was intentional, then that could be the trigger for the override. Something like ""action:create_zendesk_ticket"" would virtually never occur naturally in a message (avoiding false positives); if we embedded it by hand in our email signature, it wouldn't be too obtrusive to the recipient of the email.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

We currently have a way to view all tags across all tickets, or see all tickets with a specific tag, but those really aren't enough.GOAL: Allow Agents to view a comprehensive list of all tags that exists on existing tickets, what tags Triggers and Automations interact with, as well as which tags are linked to Custom Ticket Fields. To allow Agents to group tags and define special behaviors/rules that apply to those tags. To allow Agents to refer to an entire group of Tags when using Trigger or Automation conditionals. To allow Agent to link a specific tag to a piece of Information/Data, using them to fill a placeholder.PROPOSED FEATURES:List all tags across all existing Tickets, Triggers, Automations & Custom Ticket FieldsThe ability to see which Triggers or Automations are interacting with a specific tag or tag group and the type of interaction. (Condition or Action)The ability to Group Tags and define special rules at the Group level. Groups don't need to contain more than one Tag.Tag Groups can be used in Trigger & Automation Conditionals & Actions.Use Case: If a tag group is referenced in a Contains none of the following Trigger conditional, then Agents would be able to update the Tag Group directly instead of needing to edit each individual trigger. Allowing for greater flexibility in logic design for Triggers & Automations. Pairs with Tag Linked Information.Example Group Rule: Mutual Exclusivity. Make it so that tags in a specific group cannot be applied to the same ticket at the same time. Streamlines logic and pairs well with Tag Linked Information.Example Group Rule: Non-Inheritable. Make it so all tags in a specific group cannot be inherited by Follow-Up tickets. Allows simplified control over which tags are carried forward to a new ticket.Tag Linked Information: Allow Agents to link specific pieces of information to a tag. Everything from Comment Text, to Agents, to Groups and More. Allow a single tag to be linked to a single Agent, single Group, or a specific Agent & Group combination.Use Case: Trigger Action to assign a ticket references a mutually exclusive Tag Group. All tags in group are linked to a different Agent. Action reads tag group and assigns the ticket to the Agent which matches a tag on the ticket. This also works with Groups. Good for handling automatic escalation or sorting via triggers.Use Case: Macro or Trigger is used to create a public ticket comment. Macro/Trigger can reference Tags on ticket to fetch information to be used within comment placeholder. Enables a larger number of Macros/Triggers to reference the same information without needing to add that information into each Macro/Trigger. Simplifies updates to such information by centralizing where it is stored.Use Case: A new action option could check who a ticket is currently assigned to and assign the corresponding Tag from a selected Tag Group.Obviously this would be a major feature. Implementing an entire new UI like this would be a large project, but I believe this would be a massive improvement for Zendesk Support. It would significantly improve the flexibility of all forms of automation within the system. Allow for more flexible and thus more streamlined Triggers.Expanding upon one of the mentioned use cases above, imagine a trigger that handles de-escalating a ticket back to the lower tier Agent who previously had it. All they need to do is update a custom ticket field to De-Escalate the ticket, and the trigger will handle returning the ticket to the original agent. We are currently using such a system, but we have a different trigger for every Group and a separate set for each Agent. Together these two sets of triggers are able to return a de-escalated ticket back to the original Agent & Group. The Group part is important as some agents exist in multiple groups.With Tag Groups and Tag Linked Information, I could reduce that to a single trigger.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

I guess I can choose solved, but that isn't the case. It's been frustrating for all of us in our department. Thank you for your consideration.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

Current screen usage in the ticketing system is ineffective. Some panels are unnecessary and can cover a significant portion of the screen real estate without providing a way to easily close them.

After they have quality checked a solved ticket they need to mark that ticket as being checked so no one else quality checks it and we know how many have been checkedWe have created a “Quality Assurance Completed” checkbox and have this displayed on the form. We ideally only want this checkbox displayed when the ticket status is “Solved”. We can’t identify any other custom fields that we can base the condition on.The workaround that has been suggested by Support so far is:Create an extra custom text field, e.g. “Custom Ticket Status” and add it to the FormCreate triggers to set this custom field to “Solved” when the standard ticket status value is SolvedCreate a condition on our custom “Quality Assurance Completed"" field that we only want it displayed when the “Custom Ticket Status” is “Solved”Use the “Ticket Field Manager” app to always hide the “Custom Ticket Status” on the FormsThis workaround seems too much effort just to hide the checkbox when the status is not solved, so we have decided to just display the checkbox for all Statuses.

mfg,Draft messages are difficult to identify and locate in new agent workspace,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/5921919015450-Draft-messages-are-difficult-to-identify-and-locate-in-new-agent-workspace,07/12/2023,"When using the new Agent Workspace, if an agent enters text for a message (public or private), Support keeps it as a distinct draft if they switch from public to private and vice versa. In the old workspace, switching between public/private carried the draft over to the other comment mode.I can't say whether one is better or worse, but when you try to leave the page in the new Agent Workspace, you get a warning about the unsent draft text left behind when switching comment modes. ie. If you start a draft on public, then change course and add an internal note instead, then submit the ticket to add the note, the draft public reply also gets carried over (without being sent - which is good).If you try to close the tab you get a message that there's unsaved work, and the little blue dot at the top tells you there's unsaved work on that ticket. However, there's no indicator about where the unsaved work is, and unclear where to look. As an agent, I would just think I forgot to submit it to begin with and submit it again, which wouldn't resolve the issue.If you pop up the public/private menu from the comment mode button, you'll see the little blue dot telling you there's an unsaved/unsent draft.

I was told that we would not have a choice once the rollout goes wide.The UI sucks hard because of the following reasons:Not able to quickly glance at the user's email address quickly. To get this info I have to click on the user profile picture when it just used to be a quick glance at the top of the ticket.The separation from the reply form and the email conversation makes the experience frustrating when you have to refer back to the history. The form feels like its in the way and I have to constantly babysit the size of it.I feel that introducing more clicks to get the same info is a step backwards.Please allow us to go back to the previous UI as an option because this new UI sucks hard. The new UI doesn't improve workflow, it makes it longer.Pretty frustrated overall as I have to use this everyday.I'm open to change if it is an improvement.

Example: Sometimes, I will keep checking with someone that does not reply to a ticket only to find out they have been OOO.Customers are made aware when the assigned Agent is OOO: Have the end user get the passthrough message for the agent OOO message so the customer knows then the agent is OOO.

Especially with partners that have large volumes of work to do on their side.This is making it harder for agents to then understand threads when having to open multiple follow ups.The easiest/most affective way to change this would be to have the option to set a specific period of days before you wish for your ticket to be in a closed state. Of course, it can stay as 28 as this is best practise for most types of tickets - But for certain ones, a larger time period would definitely be best.Could be applied via system settings or specified within triggers/automations.Many thanks!",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)
