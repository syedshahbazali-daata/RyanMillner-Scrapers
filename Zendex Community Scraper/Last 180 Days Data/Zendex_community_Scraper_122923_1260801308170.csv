Shawna James,Product feedback guidelines & how to write a good feedback post,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6207854917146-Product-feedback-guidelines-how-to-write-a-good-feedback-post,09/29/2023,"Welcome to the Product Feedback Topic for Zendesk's Platform: Apps and Integrations!No one knows our products better than you, our users. We love hearing about how you use our tools and what would make them better. This guide is here to help you understand how the product feedback process works, and how to write an effective feedback post. You may also want to check out this short video on giving product feedback at Zendesk.This topic is for product feedback about the ticketing system. Don't worry, if your post should be in another topic, the Zendesk Community Team will move your post to the correct topic.Here are a few guidelines on how to use the Product Feedback topic, so that our Product team can effectively use and apply your feedback to our product planning process:Follow the Community Code of ConductFeedback and constructive criticism are welcome. Disparaging, harassing, mean, or snarky remarks about Zendesk, its employees, vendors, partners, or other community members will not be tolerated. We’re all friends and professionals, so let’s keep it polite. We don’t like having to remove comments, but we reserve the right to do so without warning in order to maintain a positive community experience for everyone.If it's a bug, contact supportThis topic is for sharing ideas about the product. If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions. We value all feedback and we're happy to have a place to engage in these conversations.",Feedback - Apps & Integrations (Platform)

This format is meant to help our PM’s get the most information from you to better understand and log your requests. This format will be rolled out at the end of 2023 and will be enforced as a requirement for all new posts to be logged and/or responded to by product managers.Example:TITLE: Pizza Order ButtonPlease give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.]. (2-3 sentences)I would like to be able to order a pizza from my favorite restaurant directly by opening a Z2 ticket. This feature is currently affecting my agents because they are hungry and my customers because they are dealing with hungry and grumpy agents.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agent team is working late and they are hungry, but the ticket queue is too high for any of them to leave and get pizza. This button would allow for a quick click, confirmation, and order without having to leave your desk. Customizable order templates for each employee would also be amazing!When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This problem happens on a daily basis. This is critical for our business as our agents get very hungry which affects their productivity and our customer satisfaction score.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Yes, my agents have to manually order pizza on their phones using a third party app.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)I would like to see an option to order pizza in the upper right hand corner of my screen, represented by a pizza emoji which, when I click it, will take me directly to an order form for my nearest pizza shop. It would be great if the system could remember my previous order and use that data to speed up the ordering process.",Feedback - Apps & Integrations (Platform)

(2-3 sentences)Currently time is not stamped to a ticket if an API or other systematic update submits the ticket, even if the agent is actively working the open on screen and they are the ones to initiate said automated action. ALL AGENTS, TEAM MANAGERS, ADMINS, EXTERNAL 3RD PARTIES are impacted as time agent spend working on tickets is not accurately represented in reportingWhat problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agents, their managers (and contractually with 3rd party outsourcers) are held accountable to their ticket handling efficiency and occupancy. However, it has come to light that Zendesk isn't accurately accounting for all of the agent time spent when parts of processes are automated (which ZD highly encourages). In allowing for us to track all agent time spent on tickets we can solve this gap in reporting capabilities.When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This gap in reporting, is under representing agent handle time on multiple 1000's of tickets per month.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)No, but we are considering having to undo some automated actions, reverting to manual agent actions.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)Ideal situation would be to have the option to allow for time spent on a ticket to be stamped/recorded if an agent is actively working a ticket that is updated by an API event.It would be ideal if app documentation was clear on this topic from the beginning.",Feedback - Apps & Integrations (Platform)
Jay Tubino,Zendesk App Process improvement using ZIS,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6508411643034-Zendesk-App-Process-improvement-using-ZIS,12/18/2023,"We are trying to find a way to make our App work better. Our app’s purpose is to send a notification to the logged in user and update the ticket 20 minutes before and at the time of the appointment and notify the user (using “client.invoke('notify', message[, kind, duration])”) during those times as well. App will update the Due Date time located in the ticket’s custom field when initiated by the user.One of the issues that we face is that we want to update the ticket at the right time even if the user is not logged in. This is because the app currently works as a background app and user needs to be logged in for the process to work.What I have in mind is to use ZIS. Can I use ZIS to update these tickets even when user is not logged in?I am thinking of running ZIS every minute to search for matching ticket custom fields with the current date time and update them accordingly.Also, if we would use ZIS, is it possible to invoke the “notify” function to the logged in user using ZIS?Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.Thanks.",Feedback - Apps & Integrations (Platform)

It works only with a hardcoded value. So it seems that it is not possible to access to the input variable because the expression is within the data parameter $.identity (which is the API output of all identities of an user).I am totally confused because if I use just a message to log it, works. My code looks like this:""Ok"": {""Type"": ""Succeed"",""Message"": ""Phone need to be change. ID: {{$.identity}} Value: {{$.input.user_event.previous}}""}Does the transform action need the input variable as a second parameter to access to it?

Ideally, we would like the ability to either re-order how the Issue Typesare displayed or restrict the Issue Types available within the Zendesk Jira app modal.Description/Use Cases:There are various posts I have come across (#1, #2) requesting the ability to restrict the Issue Types available when users log a Jira via the integration in Zendesk. The primary reason is that you may not want to give a Support Agent logging a ticket the option to create a Jira for certain types (Epics, Tasks, etc.). In our business, there is a requirement that any Jira's logged via Zendesk should be set to Bugs. This is sometimes missed as the order of the Issue Scheme in Jira is set to Task first.Having the ability to re-order or restrict the types available (per project) in the Zendesk Jira UI would help minimise the risk of this happening.Other necessary information or resources:I appreciate that workarounds are available (using Jira automations, modifying the scheme), I believe having greater functionality available within the integration itself would help improve how it works.",Feedback - Apps & Integrations (Platform)

BAKO,Option to Hide Sensitive User Data From Agents,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6048451576218-Option-to-Hide-Sensitive-User-Data-From-Agents,08/18/2023,"Feature Request Summary:Zendesk should give admins the ability to control who can access user e-mails and phone numbers. This could be achieved by an option to redact, hash or completely make it inaccessible these user fields, for certain agent roles. Currently, there is no way to hide user information from agents, which raises a security issue while working remotely.Description/Use Cases:In our current setup, agents only respond to incoming chats and emails, they distinguish end-users by the ""requester"" field in the ticket, left side on agent workspace. On the right side there's the ""profile card"" which currently has the option to hide user details such as telephone and e-mail. However in the agent workspace there the ""user profile"" tab. this allows them to access any information of the profile.Business impact of limitation or missing feature:This is a security concern on our side as we try to explore remote working options. As user data is accessible by any user, it makes the data breaches so easy.We would much prefer to use, user id's or any other identifier to select users on tickets if needed.",Feedback - Apps & Integrations (Platform)
