We love hearing about how you use our tools and what would make them better. This guide is here to help you understand how the product feedback process works, and how to write an effective feedback post. You may also want to check out this short video on giving product feedback at Zendesk.This topic is for product feedback about the ticketing system. Don't worry, if your post should be in another topic, the Zendesk Community Team will move your post to the correct topic.Here are a few guidelines on how to use the Product Feedback topic, so that our Product team can effectively use and apply your feedback to our product planning process:Follow the Community Code of ConductFeedback and constructive criticism are welcome. Disparaging, harassing, mean, or snarky remarks about Zendesk, its employees, vendors, partners, or other community members will not be tolerated. We’re all friends and professionals, so let’s keep it polite. We don’t like having to remove comments, but we reserve the right to do so without warning in order to maintain a positive community experience for everyone.If it's a bug, contact supportThis topic is for sharing ideas about the product. If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions. We value all feedback and we're happy to have a place to engage in these conversations.",Feedback - Sales CRM (Sell)
Shawna James,Product Feedback + Feature Request Post Template,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6207850835610-Product-Feedback-Feature-Request-Post-Template,09/29/2023,"We have launched a new feedback form for your product feedback and feature requests. This format is meant to help our PM’s get the most information from you to better understand and log your requests. This format will be rolled out at the end of 2023 and will be enforced as a requirement for all new posts to be logged and/or responded to by product managers.Example:TITLE: Pizza Order ButtonPlease give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.]. (2-3 sentences)I would like to be able to order a pizza from my favorite restaurant directly by opening a Z2 ticket. This feature is currently affecting my agents because they are hungry and my customers because they are dealing with hungry and grumpy agents.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agent team is working late and they are hungry, but the ticket queue is too high for any of them to leave and get pizza. This button would allow for a quick click, confirmation, and order without having to leave your desk. Customizable order templates for each employee would also be amazing!When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This problem happens on a daily basis. This is critical for our business as our agents get very hungry which affects their productivity and our customer satisfaction score.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Yes, my agents have to manually order pizza on their phones using a third party app.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)I would like to see an option to order pizza in the upper right hand corner of my screen, represented by a pizza emoji which, when I click it, will take me directly to an order form for my nearest pizza shop. It would be great if the system could remember my previous order and use that data to speed up the ordering process.",Feedback - Sales CRM (Sell)
Eric Herzberg,Contact and Lead Picture,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6350802146458-Contact-and-Lead-Picture,11/06/2023,"Please give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.]. (2-3 sentences)I would like to be able to attach a photo to a Contact or Lead. I make 99% of my sales calls in person and it would be helpful to have a photo of someone I may have once before 9 months earlier. This issue affects end users who are prospecting in person and are getting older (my memory isn't what it used to be).What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)This would put a face to a name and increase the ease of initiating a conversation. I have hundreds of contacts in a three state territory.About a week ago I was calling on private Christian collleges and made some new contacts. It would be difficult for me to pic these folks out of a crowd because after a while everyone begins to look familiar. Having a pic that I could glance at on my mobile phone would increase my confidence going into meetings.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)No real workaround except maybe using their facebook or linkedin url to see a photo.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)I would like to see leads and contacts have the ability to store and display a picture. This could be as simple as adding an attachment to their contact card.",Feedback - Sales CRM (Sell)
Jeremy Evaro,Lead Conversion to existing contact ,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6334368998554-Lead-Conversion-to-existing-contact-,11/02/2023,"When we get a new lead generated from our webform, we would like to link that ""lead"" to an existing contact/account. Sometimes current customers fill out our webform and currently, we would need to convert that lead. Then search for both accounts in the contacts section and merge them.When we click ""convert"" on a lead we would like the ability to link that to any existing contact record right from the conversion box. Not sure how much development would go into a suggested matching record. When you click convert, ZD will search all fields with data and find/suggest any matching records or give us the option to search for an existing record.",Feedback - Sales CRM (Sell)

We are trying to test some changes and do not want to do it against production.Has anyone else encountered the need for a Zendesk Sell Sandbox account for testing, and how did they get around it?",Feedback - Sales CRM (Sell)

If I go on vacation or it's a national holiday, it doesn't make sense to have emails still send.I should be able to block a date, and any emails that fall on it are automatically rescheduled.",Feedback - Sales CRM (Sell)
Roel Veldhuyzen,Possible to automatically become Collaborator when changing Stage of a deal?,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/5943066534810-Possible-to-automatically-become-Collaborator-when-changing-Stage-of-a-deal-,07/19/2023,"When someone other than the owner of a deal changes the Stage, it would be nice if that user automatically became a Collaborator on that deal (or got a question if they want that to happen). Is there an option to make that happen, or is it possible to have that option in the future?",Feedback - Sales CRM (Sell)
Kathy Amato,Email Tracking - Open and Hyperlink Clicks no longer visible,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/5925443074330-Email-Tracking-Open-and-Hyperlink-Clicks-no-longer-visible,07/13/2023,"I noticed there has been yet another change to the user interface which is not helpful and hope they will fix it soon. The ability to see if someone has opened an email and also click onto a hyperlink in the email has disappeared. Additionally, I am no longer receiving notifications of when people view an email. These constant changes that never improve the user interface are very annoying.",Feedback - Sales CRM (Sell)
