We love hearing about how you use our tools and what would make them better. This guide is here to help you understand how the product feedback process works, and how to write an effective feedback post. You may also want to check out this short video on giving product feedback at Zendesk.This topic is for product feedback about the ticketing system. Don't worry, if your post should be in another topic, the Zendesk Community Team will move your post to the correct topic.Here are a few guidelines on how to use the Product Feedback topic, so that our Product team can effectively use and apply your feedback to our product planning process:Follow the Community Code of ConductFeedback and constructive criticism are welcome. Disparaging, harassing, mean, or snarky remarks about Zendesk, its employees, vendors, partners, or other community members will not be tolerated. We’re all friends and professionals, so let’s keep it polite. We don’t like having to remove comments, but we reserve the right to do so without warning in order to maintain a positive community experience for everyone.If it's a bug, contact supportThis topic is for sharing ideas about the product. If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions. We value all feedback and we're happy to have a place to engage in these conversations.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

This format is meant to help our PM’s get the most information from you to better understand and log your requests. This format will be rolled out at the end of 2023 and will be enforced as a requirement for all new posts to be logged and/or responded to by product managers.Example:TITLE: Pizza Order ButtonPlease give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.]. (2-3 sentences)I would like to be able to order a pizza from my favorite restaurant directly by opening a Z2 ticket. This feature is currently affecting my agents because they are hungry and my customers because they are dealing with hungry and grumpy agents.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agent team is working late and they are hungry, but the ticket queue is too high for any of them to leave and get pizza. This button would allow for a quick click, confirmation, and order without having to leave your desk. Customizable order templates for each employee would also be amazing!When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This problem happens on a daily basis. This is critical for our business as our agents get very hungry which affects their productivity and our customer satisfaction score.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Yes, my agents have to manually order pizza on their phones using a third party app.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)I would like to see an option to order pizza in the upper right hand corner of my screen, represented by a pizza emoji which, when I click it, will take me directly to an order form for my nearest pizza shop. It would be great if the system could remember my previous order and use that data to speed up the ordering process.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)
James Thomas,Add reassignment functionality when using auto-accept for live chat and messaging,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6535954396954-Add-reassignment-functionality-when-using-auto-accept-for-live-chat-and-messaging,12/26/2023,"Please give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.]. (2-3 sentences)I would like to be able to utilize the new auto-accept functionality for live chat. We're unable to utilize this new feature until a reassignment functionality is added. Reassignment currently exists and works as expected when not using auto-accept. Reassignment (Reasignment Timeout & Chats Reassigned) are key chat routing settings that we can't live without.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agents often forget to change their statuses to Invisible at the end of their shift, leading to chats routing to agents who aren't actually available to take the chat. Auto assigning chats with no reassignment rules will lead to customers being assigned to an unavailable agent with no reply. This would be an unacceptable customer experience.When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)Support reps forgetting to change their status at the end of a shift is almost a daily occurrence.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)We are currently using chat without the auto-accept functionality. We would like to use the auto-accept functionality, but only if re-assignment is added.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)Keep the existing Automatic Idle/Reassignment rules that we have now, but be able to use the new auto-accept function in tandem.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)
Atanas Tomov,Product Feedback: Messaging authentication limitation,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6520601639834-Product-Feedback-Messaging-authentication-limitation,12/21/2023,"Hello,The main limitation in this topic is accounts in Zendesk can have only one External ID. Currently whenever an end-user requests a messaging conversation and is authenticated, an account with External ID is created and if there is more than 1 brand - this creates additional accounts which then have to be merged into the main e-mail account. If for example, the end-user has social channels as well (like Facebook, X corp. etc.), this generates more accounts.A solution for this would mean a unified account which will improve agent experience.This impacts us on a daily basis and as a workaround, it is possible to utilize API calls to merge accounts, however this is not ideal as it can be done only with lower traffic and there is a limit to how much API calls we can make and they can be utilized more efficiently elsewhere. As a workaround of the workaround, we can get an API calls add-on, however it will have to be free of charge.An ideal solution for this would be to remove External ID as unique identified and make it the same as in Chat product.Thank you.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

In this case, sometimes Messaging has to be disabled and reenabled during testing and if this is required several times, having to fill out a form and waiting for approval every time will definitely delay us.Ideally, we would like admins to be able to have such control in Sandbox.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

Currently, banned visitors do still see the chat widget, and can request a chat. That chat is just never served. It sits in the Visitor List as a requested chat, but is never pushed to an agent.I've recently contacted ZD support and asked if a banned visitor hanging in the queue like that will affect our wait time or response time metrics. The response was that it does affect our metrics. I also asked if there is a way to stop banned visitors from beginning a chat so they do not appear in our visitor queue. There is not.I currently do not have a workaround identified to either of these issues so when a banned visitor returns and begins a chat, there is not way to stop that requester who may hang in the queue for an hour or more from affecting out metrics.Any thoughts?",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

Antonio Auctane,Messaging: create a new/separate tickets for each different issues reported in a messaging conversation,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6452230615706-Messaging-create-a-new-separate-tickets-for-each-different-issues-reported-in-a-messaging-conversation,12/03/2023,"We are implementing Messaging and I understand that Messaging is a continuous conversation, but our need is to create a new ticket when the messaging conversation is related to another issue or another order, instead of reopening the same ticket. We don't mind the continuous conversation, we just need to create a new ticket when the issue is different.For our use cases we must track every ticket with the associated order number, which means that we need a ticket for every order number, we can't have 1 ticket with mixed order numbers, as we will loose traceability that is very important for us. For us the order number is a custom field that is essential in each one of our workflows.Let's say that:User ""ABC"" starts a messaging conversation related to order ""123"" and ticket ""001"" is created. Ticket ""001"" is responded via email by the agent, because it can't be resolved via messaging as it requires an escalation to third party via side conversation. The ticket will be solved once we have the response via the third party. Ticket ""001"" must remain associated to order ""123!""The same user ""ABC"" engage again in a messaging conversation related this time to a different order ""333"", this will reopen the same messaging ticket ""001"", which was related to order number ""123"". This will overwrite the order ""123"" with the order ""333"". This is why in this instance a new ticket must be created different from ""001"".Our need is therefore a simple trigger or a mechanism that allows the user to continue enjoying the continuous conversation, but from an ticketing agent point of view we need to create a new ticket when the issue is related to a different order number or another issue.Why this is important?Every ticket is associated to an order number, and every order number must be stored for reporting and most importantly every order needs an escalation to a third party which will change based on the order number, this cannot be solved in seconds it may require from 24 to 48 hours to resolve the ticket.Is there any solution that allows creating a new ticket when the issue is different?Thanks",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

The feedback provided by the CSA is that this notification causes confusion because even though the agent handles the conversation and then solves it - the notification does not disappear until it is manually marked as read by the agent.If conversation is linked to the notification and it is removed / auto-marked as read upon the ticket being marked as solved - agents will not get confused as to where they got the notification from and why they are not seeing any updates in their dashboard.Resolving this will not cause a panic in agents and lose time trying to find where this notification came from and why they cannot see the ticket related to it.Only solution is currently for agents to mark these notification manually as read. Suggested solution is notifications to be auto-marked as read upon ticket marked as solved.Looking forward to this functionality.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

Legacy Web Widget had an ""identify"" feature inside the Javascript API that covered this issue, but we can't find an alternative inside messaging.Also, we would need to keep track of how many times each option of the flow have been selected by the end users (analytics functionalities), so we can improve the efficiency of the bot.Description/Use Cases:- Integration with Active Directory and/or ""identify"" Javascript API feature, as it already exists in Legacy Web Widget.- Analytics feature, letting us know the volume of use of each option of the flow.Thank you for your attention.

The external one does not require end-users to sign in to access the help articles. The internal one does, and is limited to a user segment with emails matching our company domain.Basically only our employees should be able to access our internal knowledge.When setting up the conversation bot for our external help centre, we are able to customise this 'If the bot finds relevant articles' section;However, this section does not appear when customising the conversation bot for our internal help centre;If we were able to use the Generative AI for Bots feature on the conversation bot for our internal help centre, it would allow our employees to interact with the web widget on our help centre to get the information they need.All the benefits our customers experience with our external help centre conversation bot would also be experienced by our employees (which, in a way, are our Operations team's customers).I can not source any workaround, other than a suggestion by a ZD support agent to make the help centre publicly available, but to make all the articles restricted to our employee user segment. This isn't really an elegant solution, and would also mean users who aren't signed in could find our internal help centre (I know they couldn't see the articles, but it's still not great is it).",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

And in Agent Workspace, our agents cannot pick it up manually from the Visitors List.There are situations where a user may have been incorrectly suspended automatically by the system, for example, and we'd still like some way to know they tried to contact us. But even if users were legitimately suspended, it still makes no sense for them to be able to open chats. They will then sit in queue forever, trapped in a limbo where they can't reach an agent. This makes it look like we have poor customer service. But agents will likely never be aware this chat was attempted.We would like these users to either be prevented from starting a chat altogether, or for us to be able to have a chat trigger directed to suspended users, or some kind of notification sent to them automatically.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

As we are all working remotely, we have encountered a common problem – no sound alerts for incoming chats/conversation. Instead, we solely rely on the notification bubble that displays the number of message assigned to an agent. We just recently switched workspaces and our chats are now in conversations.I reached out to Zendesk support, and after some back and forth, they confirmed something interesting. It turns out we only get chat sounds when our routing is set to ""Broadcast."" Unfortunately for us, as we are using the ""Assigned"" chat route, there are no incoming chat sounds. Chat sounds are only heard when the chat has been accepted, and the agent is looking at another tab and the customer replies to the conversation.This situation makes multitasking more challenging for our agents. They need to continuously monitor the Zendesk tab to detect if there's a chat assigned to them. So, we're really hoping for a quick fix here.

It seems that even the smallest changes can sometimes take a while to implement in Zendesk.However, there are some complications associated with adding images using the ""Send message"" feature. It's important to note that the error I'll be pointing out doesn't occur with images added through the ""Add carousel"" option.If we use ""Send message"" and add a picture in this step there are problems.The problem described from a developer's perspective is that customers/visitors may expect to be directed to a specific page when they click on the image, especially when presented with the option to ""Open in a new window."" that Zendesk has put on top if you hover the image in the bot window.However, in the given scenario, clicking on the image only opens a larger version of the image, which can lead to confusion. And all in all that is just bad UI design.To address this issue, there are a couple of potential solutions. One option would be to include a link we could put in the back-end - to have desired effect of having the image directing the customers to the desired page. Just the same as if we added a button below to take the customer there. This way, when visitors click on the image, they will be redirected to the intended destination rather than just viewing a larger version of the image.Alternatively, if incorporating a link within the image is not feasible or desired, another solution could be to remove the click ability of the image altogether and also the ""Open in a new window"" promp on hover. By removing the ability to click on the image, it would eliminate any confusion or expectation of being directed to a different page.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

I have tried to find the option to enable/disable chat history from admin console tool, but it seems now does not have that kind of option anymore. I'm wondering whether is it possible to reset chat history in client side? The attachment is what I found the internet which has the option I wanted.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

We would like to see a functionality where we can create conditional custom statuses that will be available only for certain people, groups or roles as not all statuses will be practical or relevant for the particular segment.

Wesley Bowles,Heavily Weighted Keywords in Messaging Article Recommendations,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/5921878862106-Heavily-Weighted-Keywords-in-Messaging-Article-Recommendations,07/12/2023,"So we're having an issue where it seems one or two keywords are too heavily weighted in our Messaging bot article recommendations.In our company's case, the word ""Design"" is used quite frequently for a variety of intents throughout our help centre articles.The problem we're having is the article recommendations are almost always never what the customer is looking for because the main keyword the messaging bot seems to pick up on is ""Design"" rather than everything else in the customers question.For example, we have a large section of our help center devoted to accessibility and how users can make their designs accessible. If a user asks the question ""How do I make my design accessible"" No accessibility related articles. Instead numerous completely unrelated articles are provided simply because the word ""Design"" is included in them.I guess what this boils down to is there doesn't seem to be a way for me to tell the messaging bot specifically to ignore common words, in our case, the word ""design"".And yes I realize the best option here is to craft an answer for the bot if I know I want to target the accessible intent. The problem surfaces for lesser known intents we don't have crafted answers for yet and the negative user experience customers receive when chatting with the bot.I'll also highlight that this is NOT the case for email article recommendations. The email auto reply suggestions actually handle this MUCH better and customers get the articles that make sense.I hope that makes sense? TLDR, we have a broadly used keyword that seems to be too heavily weighted causing completely inaccurate recommendations within messaging.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

A crucial feature pertaining to WhatsApp automation appears to have been removed.In the classic module, we were afforded the capability to generate ticket assignments based on the ""country code."" This allowed the agent responsible for the region associated with that phone number to provide customer service. Regrettably, this feature is absent in the new Zendesk system.I have previously lodged a complaint by opening a ticket regarding this matter, but to no avail; no solution was provided. The absence of this feature significantly increases the amount of manual work required to allocate tickets to the appropriate agents.If there is no foreseeable solution to this feature deficiency, we will have to consider migrating to another customer service platform.I am hopeful that Zendesk will address this concern swiftly, considering the significant impact it has on our operational efficiency.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Classic zendesk (when it worked)",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)
