We love hearing about how you use our tools and what would make them better. This guide is here to help you understand how the product feedback process works, and how to write an effective feedback post. You may also want to check out this short video on giving product feedback at Zendesk.This topic is for product feedback about the ticketing system. Don't worry, if your post should be in another topic, the Zendesk Community Team will move your post to the correct topic.Here are a few guidelines on how to use the Product Feedback topic, so that our Product team can effectively use and apply your feedback to our product planning process:Follow the Community Code of ConductFeedback and constructive criticism are welcome. Disparaging, harassing, mean, or snarky remarks about Zendesk, its employees, vendors, partners, or other community members will not be tolerated. We’re all friends and professionals, so let’s keep it polite. We don’t like having to remove comments, but we reserve the right to do so without warning in order to maintain a positive community experience for everyone.If it's a bug, contact supportThis topic is for sharing ideas about the product. If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions.

(1-2 sentences)Agent team is working late and they are hungry, but the ticket queue is too high for any of them to leave and get pizza. This button would allow for a quick click, confirmation, and order without having to leave your desk.

How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This problem happens on a daily basis. This is critical for our business as our agents get very hungry which affects their productivity and our customer satisfaction score.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Yes, my agents have to manually order pizza on their phones using a third party app.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)I would like to see an option to order pizza in the upper right hand corner of my screen, represented by a pizza emoji which, when I click it, will take me directly to an order form for my nearest pizza shop.

For example 1 phone number with 10 min wrap-up and a dedicated team handling it and 2 min wrap-up time for regular phone lines, considering that regular CSA's will handle calls on this phone number.Issue here is that if an end-user calls the line with the 10 min wrap-up time and this call is being forwarded to / answered by another team with usual wrap-up time 2 min - on this call wrap-up time will be 10 min.

Consequently, we can't route tickets which were created initially from an incoming call, as if it was an email ticket. These tickets are not calls anymore and shouldn't be identified as Calls.Example: Agent A answered to an incoming call but this call needs to be escalated to Agent B. Agent B is currently not available. Thus, Agent A needs to desynchronize the call. Agent A finishes the call with the customer and assign this ticket to Agent B. Afterwards, as soon as the Agent B comes back, the ticket can't be routed to them because Agent B is available via email only and not for Calls. This is a big limitation here, because even if the Agent B is Online for Calls, they will receive these tickets with completed calls, one by one, instead of getting assigned these tickets according to their capacity. As I said, these tickets are not calls anymore and should be routed according to the Email capacity not Call capacity.",Feedback - Voice (Talk)

Denis Oskolkov,Lack of Keyboard Support in Zendesk Talk Dialer,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6231080754330-Lack-of-Keyboard-Support-in-Zendesk-Talk-Dialer,10/06/2023,"Hello everyone,Currently, Zendesk Talk Dialer provides keyboard support for entering the initial phone number, which is a great feature that enhances our efficiency. However, when it comes to interacting with an IVR system during a call that requires input, we find that the keyboard functionality is not available. Main use case, calling into a Zoom room. The only way to navigate through the IVR system is to use the mouse to click the buttons on the dialer.While this method gets the job done, it is significantly slower compared to using a keyboard. As you know, in a customer support environment, every second matters. The time difference between using a mouse click and a keyboard can impact our customer service delivery and overall productivity.I am sure that other members of the Zendesk community also share this concern. I believe that extending keyboard support to the whole process in the Zendesk Talk Dialer, especially during IVR interactions, would greatly enhance the user experience and service efficiency.We would greatly appreciate it if the Zendesk team could take this feedback into serious consideration and provide a response regarding potential solutions or planned updates to address this issue.Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.",Feedback - Voice (Talk)

Hold length, Time between calls (idle/available timer), total call length are all possible data points/metrics to display in this live call timer.Description/Use Case:In many call centers, agents are held to specific timings for Average Handle Time/Call Duration and other call statuses such as Hold Length. A timer that is displayed to the ZenDesk agent in real time would help the agent track durations and be more effective with their call control and productivity.A timer function already exists for incoming calls to display how long the caller has been waiting, and this functionality could be expanded to support things such as:Total Call LengthHold LengthMute LengthAvailable time between callsAgents frequently use hold as time to research a caller's question or issue, or to contact a higher tier support agent for assistance. The current experience for ZenDesk agents requires them to manually track this time via another method in additional to completing the task the Hold is being used for.Business impact of limitation or missing featureCall Centers or Customer Support teams typically have goals set for Average Handle Time (Call Length) and Time that the caller is allowed to be on hold (Hold Time). Many times things like hold times are monitored per hold and per call, for example, you can have a customer on hold for 6 minutes per call, but only 2 minutes at a time before checking in. I have seen this feature on many other softphone products and would love to see it in ZenDesk.This timer feature would support this standard practice, keep a more positive experience for the caller, and improve productivity for ZenDesk agents. The feature would also enable internal QA and Leadership teams to coach agents to more accurately adhere to these requirements.Other Necessary Information or Resources:Additional ZenDesk support posts asking for similar featurehttps://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/4409217238170-Display-length-of-holdhttps://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/4679638076570-Hold-timerhttps://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/5461753412890-Idle-Time-Between-Callshttps://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/4408868258074-Calculating-agents-idle-time?page=1#community_comment_4418172968218Screenshot of existing Incoming Call Wait Timer",Feedback - Voice (Talk)

Kenny Rohan,Voicemail treatment and reporting,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6136523687834-Voicemail-treatment-and-reporting,09/11/2023,"In past call center services we've used, the wait time reports also took into consideration how long the voicemail waited before getting a callback. So wait time reports were truly inclusive of live wait time and voicemail wait time to receive a callback. In addition the call center software treated a callback and voicemail as one in the same. So the caller could leave a callback/voicemail which would hold their place in the queue. So when an agent became available, the callback/voicemail was given to them to act on. In Zendesk it seems that a callback is just a phone number waiting in the queue, so when the agent becomes available, they don't know what the call is about so they cannot prepare. And a voicemail just becomes a ticket which now relies on agents to manually go and check on.It would be great if ZD would provide the option for a callback and voicemail be one in the same and waiting in the queue. Then also wait time reports would be all inclusive. Thanks",Feedback - Voice (Talk)

Paul Cano,Call avoidance - agent refreshes browser when receiving an incoming call,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6049969078554-Call-avoidance-agent-refreshes-browser-when-receiving-an-incoming-call,08/18/2023,"i need help finding the right reporting structure to ensure that when a agent receives a call but before hitting an action such as to answer, to decline, or to not answer at all the agent could simply refresh their web browser and the call is then round robin to the next agent in line.there should be some type of defined attribute that detects this in a reporting structure.I've made several tests within our zendesk talk account and I'm not seeing anything that would highlight a agent ""rolling a call over"" simply by refreshing their web browser window while they are logged in as available. I've observed that the caller icon comes up on the agents dashboard to answer or decline. but when the agent refreshes their browser instead of answering or declining the call it simply re-routes to the next available agent.accepted calls, declined calls, and missed calls do not track this call avoidance approach. Zendesk talk platform solely works out of a web browser and I would expect that you and your team would approach this concern as a potential design flaw that should have. I've reached out to support and they keep giving me recipes on leg instance and accepted calls but leg instance does not detect this form of action.I can't be the only one who's run into this design flaw.",Feedback - Voice (Talk)

Kenny Rohan,Agent statuses - a way to minimize list ,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6003772630042-Agent-statuses-a-way-to-minimize-list-,08/05/2023,"We plan to use the agent statuses frequently and we will have around 15 customized ones. When the agent is setting their status, the list is elongated because each one shows the information of each channel routing. So, you must scroll through the list. It would be nice to have a minimize tab, so each item shows as only a single line. In addition, it would be useful if the agent could click to see the description if they choose so they know they are making the correct choice. I can send some examples if helpful. Thank you!",Feedback - Voice (Talk)

And as tags used with IVR keypresses make their way into tickets, they can be used to influence group, priority, and skills of the calls for call routing.You can use all existing trigger conditions existing in Support.For more information about Omnichannel routing, see About omnichannel routing with unified agent status.IVR keypress reportingCustomers can build reports in Explore based on tags present on the ticket. Giving a peek into the callers’ key presses when using IVR.Additional context to agentsAs tags are visible on tickets, they provide agents with additional context about the caller journey when answering calls.Who can try the experience?The new experience will be available for the customers using Zendesk Talk with Omnichannel routing, who are on a Professional or Enterprise plan.What is the timeline of the release?The exact timeline is in the works, broadly speaking, we are planning to release this in H2, 2023.How can I follow the release or leave feedback?Please follow this article. We’ll keep updating and releasing more details as we further develop the functionality.

During business hours, we would like to use voicemail as my team can quickly manage any voicemail tickets and we aren't being charged for minutes by our after hours answering service.I've confirmed with ZenDesk that you can not create a setting that allows Voicemails to flow to your team during business hours and then overflow to our answering service after hours. We must manually change the setting at the start/end of each day.Impact: With the current requirement that all unanswered calls flow to our after hours service we are incurring fees to take a message vs the message simply flowing directly to one of my agents that may respond quickly OR we incur process/labor costs by creating a daily manual task to change this setting to start/end every day.",Feedback - Voice (Talk)

I'm afraid this appears to be a current limitation in Zendesk Talk.'What I want to know, is whether we can set up a system that identifies the exact options selected during the IVR Routing, before a Talk call is made into a ticket (i.e. live call OR ticket made by leaving a voicemail message). I had suggested some form of trigger which can add a unique tag but this wasn't possible currently.We want to use a method like the above or something better, to identify the route taken in IVR to reach the ticket stage. A feature such as this would benefit our team to know how well the IVR routing works - i.e. did the call go to the right department?",Feedback - Voice (Talk)
