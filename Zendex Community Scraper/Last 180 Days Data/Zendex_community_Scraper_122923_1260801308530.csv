Shawna James,Product feedback guidelines & how to write a good feedback post,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6207824610202-Product-feedback-guidelines-how-to-write-a-good-feedback-post,09/29/2023,"Welcome to the Product Feedback Topic for Zendesk's Help Center (Guide)!No one knows our products better than you, our users. We love hearing about how you use our tools and what would make them better. This guide is here to help you understand how the product feedback process works, and how to write an effective feedback post. You may also want to check out this short video on giving product feedback at Zendesk.This topic is for product feedback about the ticketing system. Don't worry, if your post should be in another topic, the Zendesk Community Team will move your post to the correct topic.Here are a few guidelines on how to use the Product Feedback topic, so that our Product team can effectively use and apply your feedback to our product planning process:Follow the Community Code of ConductFeedback and constructive criticism are welcome. Disparaging, harassing, mean, or snarky remarks about Zendesk, its employees, vendors, partners, or other community members will not be tolerated. We’re all friends and professionals, so let’s keep it polite. We don’t like having to remove comments, but we reserve the right to do so without warning in order to maintain a positive community experience for everyone.If it's a bug, contact supportThis topic is for sharing ideas about the product. If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions. We value all feedback and we're happy to have a place to engage in these conversations.",Feedback - Help Center (Guide)

This format is meant to help our PM’s get the most information from you to better understand and log your requests. This format will be rolled out at the end of 2023 and will be enforced as a requirement for all new posts to be logged and/or responded to by product managers.Example:TITLE: Pizza Order ButtonPlease give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.].

This feature is currently affecting my agents because they are hungry and my customers because they are dealing with hungry and grumpy agents.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agent team is working late and they are hungry, but the ticket queue is too high for any of them to leave and get pizza. This button would allow for a quick click, confirmation, and order without having to leave your desk. Customizable order templates for each employee would also be amazing!When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This problem happens on a daily basis. This is critical for our business as our agents get very hungry which affects their productivity and our customer satisfaction score.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Yes, my agents have to manually order pizza on their phones using a third party app.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)I would like to see an option to order pizza in the upper right hand corner of my screen, represented by a pizza emoji which, when I click it, will take me directly to an order form for my nearest pizza shop.

There also wasn't a space problem on the right-hand side menu after you added the 'Article settings' button, which moved everything into that settings area.

I can't delete the table in my article, as the option is hidden by the bar at the bottom. I have to open the HTML code and delete it from there, which takes longer and can lead to mistakes.Also, the fact that the Save button is now always in the same state (blue and clickable), whether you have updated content or not, is confusing.Another feedback, not linked to the latest release but to an older one, is that we used to be able to reload the preview of an article directly from the preview.

Dan Cooper,Guide Team Publishing API Endpoints,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6482703860506-Guide-Team-Publishing-API-Endpoints,12/12/2023,"Please give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.]. (2-3 sentences)The Guide API has some significant gaps related to being able to view team publishing statuses, archived content, and being able to manage owner/template status. As you go deeper with Guide you start needing more powerful workflows and while most of Zendesk has a rich API, Guide doesn't give many options to fill in gaps. Some specific issues we've run into over time include not being able to set owners or templates on articles, not being able to properly assign content updates to staff (you can only notify the assignee and there is no comment history), we can't systematically archive/restore content, and we can't establish custom workflows that allow us to manage review status for content teams that don't directly work in Zendesk but collaborate with Zendesk users.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)It would be great if Zendesk could solve all of our problems, but priorities happen, and it would be great if we had the ability to build solutions that allowed us to capitalize on the things that Zendesk has done right. When Zendesk can't prioritize some features, we can. In a conversation of build vs buy, sometimes the only option is buy elsewhere.When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This used to be a daily issue for us, but there has been so little movement that we've had to move onto other workflows that are worse because of it. We want to use Zendesk, but it's difficult to onboard teams that aren't Zendesk primary and we don't have great options to fill in the gaps to allow those teams to really get into Zendesk content management. This has lead to many conversations with teams to load content into Zendesk that have fizzled out or become stagnant because the built in workflows don't cut it. Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Most of our primary use cases just don't use Zendesk despite an attempt to do so. We have to have staff chase down content updates and owners over time because owners and notifications aren't easily maintained in a way that is effective for us.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)Give us new endpoints to do what we can today, but with a path for us to build the workflows that work best for us.Article endpoints should include the ability to read and set the owner and templateAdd team publishing endpoints for Set Article Review Status, Assign Article, List TasksAdd Schedule article publicationendpointAdd List/Restore/Delete Archived Article endpoints.These would give us the ability to create workflows that can let us establish consistent Zendesk workflows around owner and templates used in a UI that we control. We could allow for article content to be pulled into another system for review workflows with non-Zendesk teams and allow for us to push status updates back to Zendesk. For article assignment, it would give us the ability to track comment threads on an article absent an option in Zendesk.I understand there are other initiatives in progress at Zendesk that may negate some of the pain points above, but it would be great to see some API level options for past and new Guide features to let us do more with the product.",Feedback - Help Center (Guide)

(2-3 sentences)When using the ""Replace media"" feature, we would like a way to prevent the new image from publishing immediately. This issue affects our agents because we are often staging UI updates in our help desk before our system is officially updated, so publishing the new image immediately isn't conducive to our needs. It's affecting our customers because they need the information in our help desk to match our live UI.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agents need to be able to complete work ahead of time so that they're not scrambling to update all of our articles after our system updates go live. Being able to queue image updates would ensure that our updates are timely and that our customers aren't waiting for accurate documentation.When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)We update our system every two weeks. I was trying to update an article last week, and I was excited by the Replace Media feature until I realized that the new image was published immediately. Because that new functionality isn't live yet, I had to go back into the article, find the old image, replace the new one with the old one, re-publish with the old image, then upload the new image (without using the Replace Image feature), so that I could queue up a draft with the new image. The result was a lot of extra work plus superfluous images in our system that will need to be removed once the update is live.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem?

(2-3 sentences)When creating sandbox environments, the Guide production instance needs to be available to copy into the sandbox as well. Not having a production copy in the sandbox greatly impacts the ability to test bot an AI functionality. The new generative AI functionality needs to be able to pull information from Guide when suggesting solutions to customers. Re-creating a handful of articles in the sandbox version of Guide does not allow for large scale, production comparable validation testing. Not having this feature is forcing us to do validation testing of the bot and generative AI functionality in production. Which, as expected, causes less than ideal bot interactions for customers and a sub-par customer experience. This also causes admins to have to work off-hours in order to test, when they should be able to test during normal business hours in a sandbox.What problem do you see this solving?

Currently users can only see the changes to two consecutive revisions.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)When editing an article, Guide writers will save the article frequently. This results in a large number of entries in the Revisions page, making it very difficult to see a summary of all changes that were made to the article in a given time period.

Seeing the ""out of"" count makes me unlikely to bother reading the article, even if it contains the answer I need.Problem 2: ""Unhelpful"" votes are ultimately unhelpful and not actionable for admins.Although I can pull a report with my ""helpful"" and ""unhelpful"" votes on any given article, this data is utterly useless because it leaves me blindly guessing about why a customer voted negatively on an article.Is the article too long? Not long enough? Is it missing a key piece of information? Is there a broken link in my content? Was the article published in the wrong section? Is the labeling and keywording poorly optimized? Is the customer simply clicking ""unhelpful"" because they're having a bad day? — I have no idea, because I have zero insight into why a user voted the article as ""unhelpful.""Admins should be able to: Toggle off the ""out of"" portion of the vote count on articles, so that only ""x found this helpful"" displays to End Users.Gather additional feedback from users who vote articles as ""unhelpful,"" including:- A comment body (reportable in Explore) and - (optional to End User) the User fields to collect name + email address, which gives us the opportunity to follow up with the user if needed.There are half a dozen user-submitted guides in the Community about how to do these things with custom code, but most are many years old and unfortunately none of those custom solutions work as of Nov 2023. Additionally, we can't get Zendesk Support's assistance on this because at this time, the goal is considered too custom.These features are basic requirements for any Help Center feedback module; they really should be included in Guide natively.TL;DR: Article votes should not actively amplify negative perceptions about our articles or our brand — and — if negative votes are not actionable, negative vote counts have no practical purpose.",Feedback - Help Center (Guide)

Zendesk is incompliant with worldwide best practices.Bearing in mind many companies have their employees spread all over the world in various offices, effective knowledge sharing becomes vital.However, with Zendesk forcing drafts to be unsearchable, we had to choose either to delay the knowledge sharing between internal users (employees) or to publish the unverified content to external users (customers).Who affected: both customers and all employees.How often we're affected: each day.Known workaround: use a third-party solution to make drafts searchable according to the selected visibility permissions (Visible to).Ideal solution: Make a checkbox called ""Make drafts searchable"" that will be controlled by Guide admins, so each company may adjust the workflow according to their needs.",Feedback - Help Center (Guide)

I've chosen it as my homepage due to its intuitive, elegant, and functional design. In addition, the wide range of tools that Zendesk offers is impressively robust. I still remember the days when the most recommended service was less than $29 a month. Even though it has now increased to $99 with an upfront annual subscription, I continue to believe that what Zendesk provides far exceeds anything I could develop on my own.I would like to suggest an improvement. It would be greatly beneficial if, in the public view of GUIDE, those articles that are private and marked with a security icon could be displayed, especially if they have catchy titles that would surely grab the attention of visitors. I'm convinced that many would feel encouraged to register and log in upon seeing that these contents are available once they've authenticated. Seeing a screen full of options is undoubtedly more appealing than just seeing a few articles highlighting the benefits of registration.Public article #1 🅿️Public article #2 🅿️Great title for users who have logged in 👮🏻‍♀️Magnificent title for users who have logged in 👮🏻‍♀️The best title for users who have logged in 👮🏻‍♀️In the age of AI, everyone highlights 'Do you want early access?'. Living beings' curiosity is truly remarkable. Give a mouse a piece of cheese, and next, it'll ask for a glass of milk.I suggest displaying good titles of private articles with security icons in public view of GUIDE should encourage registrations and logins.

Erin McDougal,Content tags should be separated by brand,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6009021203482-Content-tags-should-be-separated-by-brand,08/07/2023,"Feature Request Summary:Content tags should not be shared across brands. Content tags should be unique by brand to allow for a better customer and agent experience choosing from the list of content tags.Description/Use Cases:Our company has several brands in Zendesk, all representing unique product offerings to distinct customer bases. Because our products are different enough in functionality, the content tags need to be different to reflect those distinct use cases. For example, one product would have tags like Appointment Scheduling, Kiosk, and Alerts. Another product would have tags like Data Administration, Imports and Exports, and Dashboards. Displaying content tags from all brands to all customers is a very confusing experience, when they don't have access to that functionality in their brand, nor do they really recognize the names of different brands. This means we are not able to expose content tags to our end users, and they cannot add them to their Community posts themselves.Business impact of limitation or missing feature:Without content tags being split by brands, we cannot use this feature in more than one brand, which basically makes it unusable. The big benefit for us is in customers being able to add their own content tags to their Community posts, and we cannot allow it in a multiple brand environment.",Feedback - Help Center (Guide)
