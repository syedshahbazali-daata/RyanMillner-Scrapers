Walter Bellante,Transitioning to the new Explore dashboard builder: Your questions answered,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6280637453210-Transitioning-to-the-new-Explore-dashboard-builder-Your-questions-answered,10/26/2023,"Hello, Zendesk community! Following the announcementregarding the transition to the new Explore dashboard builder, we've revised our plan and put together this post to give you a comprehensive overview and address any concerns you might have.Connect with us liveBefore we delve into the transition details, we invite you to join us at our PM Roundtable on November 2, 2023. This live session provides an excellent opportunity for you to connect with our product team, ask questions, share your feedback, and learn more about the exciting features and improvements the New Dashboard Builder brings to your Zendesk experience. We look forward to seeing you there!Why is Zendesk making this change?The move is driven by our commitment to simplifying how dashboards are built. Many of you shared how the classic experience has a steep learning curve. With the new dashboard builder, we want to provide a flexible, user-tailored experience that gives control and visibility to editors. This new experience represents our commitment to empowering you to create dashboards you're proud to share.Transition processThe transition will take place using a phased approach over a 12-month period to help you prepare and adapt to the new interface gradually – starting with the General Availability (GA) of the new dashboard builder, currently planned to launch no sooner than Q1 2024.You can rest assured that Zendesk will notify account owners and administrators via email before the GA date, with reminders along the way. We will also share a detailed timeline with more information about what you can expect in each phase to guide you through this change. In the meantime, here is a high-level overview of the transition plan:Phase 1 - Beta dashboard builder GA release (4 months): The GA release of our new dashboard builder will include a host of exciting features like tabs, exports, schedules, and the ability to link filters across different datasets.During this phase, while users have the option to continue using the classic builder, it's important to note that our primary focus will be on the development and improvement of the new dashboard builder. As a result, there will be certain limitations for those continuing with the classic experience:Only highly impactful bugs will be fixed in the classic builderNo enhancements will be made to the classic builderPhase 2 - Transitionary period (4 months): Following the GA release of the new dashboard builder, there will be a transitionary period of approximately four months.During this time, you’ll still be able to edit your dashboards using the classic builder, but you won’t be able to create brand-new dashboards with it. This transitionary period will enable you to gradually adapt to the new interface and take advantage of its enhanced capabilities at your own pace.At this stage, you’ll also know how your shared dashboards are being used and will be able to identify the relevant dashboards you want to rebuild using the new dashboard builder.Phase 3 - View-only access to classic dashboards (4 months): After the transitionary period concludes, dashboards built with the classic builder will remain accessible to all users who have access, but the capabilities will be limited to view-only mode, as edit access to the classic builder will be removed. View-only mode for dashboards built in the classic builder will remain in place for another four months.Retirement of the classic view-only experience: In order to be transparent about our future plans, four (4) months after the start of the ""View-only access to classic dashboards"" phase, we will fully retire the classic dashboard. This means that the classic dashboard will no longer be available for use after this period.This phased approach is represented in the visual below.Your questions answeredFollowing the original announcement, you also raised a number of questions. We've addressed the most common questions below:Has phase 1 already started?No, this plan is set to start after the general availability (GA) of the beta builder.When is the GA of the beta builder planned?While we don’t have yet a firm date, it won’t be earlier than Q1 2024.Will there be a tool to help in migrating dashboards built with the classic builder?Yes, we are developing a tool that will allow you to quickly import reports from an existing dashboard built with the classic builder. While we don’t have an ETA yet, this tool will be available before the beginning of phase 3.What is the timeframe for accessing existing dashboards created with the classic builder?You will be able to access the existing dashboards created with the classic builder until the end of phase 3, which marks the retirement of the classic view-only experience. This phase is expected to occur approximately one year after the GA of the new dashboard builder.What features will be available at GA?Many of the features you’ve requested will be available, including:Exports in CSV, Excel, and PDF formatScheduled dashboards and dashboard restrictionsTabsLinked filters across different datasetsExcluding reports from being filteredClick hereto learn more about what features will be available at each stage.Will bookmarks be available?Bookmarks or a similar feature will be available post-GA.We recognize that bookmarks serve many important use cases. At the same time, they introduced some inconsistencies when applied across different tabs, as one bookmark could potentially override another one, causing the exposure of unnecessary data.We are working on preventing these behaviors from happening in the future while supporting the same functionalities. At the same time, some of the most important use cases will be served before the GA through dashboard restrictions or other features.You can find a more detailed answer here.Are existing reports compatible with the new builder?Yes, all existing reports are compatible with the new builder.Will you delete existing reports after the retirement of the classic view-only experience?No, we won’t. Your existing reports will be accessible via the report builder and new dashboard builder and won’t be impacted by this plan.Can you provide some guidance on how to migrate dashboards?A future article will guide you through the steps you can take to simplify this transition.At a very high level, you will be able to:Identify your most-used dashboardsDetermine whether any of them are similar enough that they would be good candidates to be combined into a single dashboard with dashboard restrictionsUse the importer tool to quickly import reports from an existing dashboardWill Professional Services be available to rebuild dashboards?Yes, they will be available as a paid service. We will share more details about their availability and pricing after the GA.How is this different from migrating from Insights?It is very different as you won’t have to rebuild any reports. Instead, you can quickly import the existing ones to a new dashboard.Your feedback matters: Join the roundtablePlease share your thoughts in the comments below. We'll incorporate your feedback into continuous improvements to the new dashboard builder.If you're interested in participating in a deeper conversation about this change, please join our PM Roundtable on November 2, 2023, where we’ll walk through the plan, show some of the new features, and answer your questions.We're excited about the improvements the new dashboard builder brings and look forward to supporting you through this transition.

We love hearing about how you use our tools and what would make them better. This guide is here to help you understand how the product feedback process works, and how to write an effective feedback post. You may also want to check out this short video on giving product feedback at Zendesk.This topic is for product feedback about the ticketing system. Don't worry, if your post should be in another topic, the Zendesk Community Team will move your post to the correct topic.Here are a few guidelines on how to use the Product Feedback topic, so that our Product team can effectively use and apply your feedback to our product planning process:Follow the Community Code of ConductFeedback and constructive criticism are welcome. Disparaging, harassing, mean, or snarky remarks about Zendesk, its employees, vendors, partners, or other community members will not be tolerated. We’re all friends and professionals, so let’s keep it polite. We don’t like having to remove comments, but we reserve the right to do so without warning in order to maintain a positive community experience for everyone.If it's a bug, contact supportThis topic is for sharing ideas about the product. If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions. We value all feedback and we're happy to have a place to engage in these conversations.",Feedback - Reporting and analytics (Explore)

This format is meant to help our PM’s get the most information from you to better understand and log your requests. This format will be rolled out at the end of 2023 and will be enforced as a requirement for all new posts to be logged and/or responded to by product managers.Example:TITLE: Pizza Order ButtonPlease give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.]. (2-3 sentences)I would like to be able to order a pizza from my favorite restaurant directly by opening a Z2 ticket. This feature is currently affecting my agents because they are hungry and my customers because they are dealing with hungry and grumpy agents.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agent team is working late and they are hungry, but the ticket queue is too high for any of them to leave and get pizza. This button would allow for a quick click, confirmation, and order without having to leave your desk. Customizable order templates for each employee would also be amazing!When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This problem happens on a daily basis. This is critical for our business as our agents get very hungry which affects their productivity and our customer satisfaction score.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Yes, my agents have to manually order pizza on their phones using a third party app.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)I would like to see an option to order pizza in the upper right hand corner of my screen, represented by a pizza emoji which, when I click it, will take me directly to an order form for my nearest pizza shop. It would be great if the system could remember my previous order and use that data to speed up the ordering process.",Feedback - Reporting and analytics (Explore)

Crawford Philleo,Change Attribute on new Dashboard Builder?,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6463547478938-Change-Attribute-on-new-Dashboard-Builder-,12/06/2023,"Hi, I was asked to cross-post to this forum from this article.I'm pretty concerned that it doesn't appear the ""Change attribute"" feature will be included with the new dashboard builder. Nearly every dashboard I have for our organization utilizes this functionality. Change Attribute widgets allow you to see a time-series report (column or line, for example) by date, week, month, quarter, hour, etc., giving the user a lot of flexibility with reporting.I will typically build a report that uses a Date ([Ticket created - date], [Ticket solved - date], etc.) time attribute as the default, and then add a Change Attribute widget giving the user flexibility to view the metrics by those other divisions of time given an associated date range (e.g.: last 12 weeks by week, last 6 months by month, 4 quarters by quarter).The change attribute is extremely useful in other ways. For example, you can build group custom attributes that are sub-sets of longer lists of custom field values or agent names, and then change attributes can be used to update a set of reports to show a different portion of the data, or as a way to change your aspect perspective of the data (kind of like decomposing, but not drilling). I find this workflow to be a little more intuitive than using data filters.Is this feature being considered for inclusion with the new dashboard builder at all? I'm under the impression that eventually we're getting kicked off the classic builder altogether. There are lots of other great features in classic (for design / layout) that I'm really sad to have to abandon.",Feedback - Reporting and analytics (Explore)

(2-3 sentences)Explore was recently updated to show all dashboards to the admin. But it doesn't solve the problem of other users with permissions editing dashboards they shouldnt edit or update.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)The team who manages dashboards would be able to stop others from editing or tampering with “official” or “connected” dashboards. They can still build their own but must not be allowed to make changes on the main dashboard.When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened?

If we cannot view this information, we have zero visibility of any lapses in service unless we manually inspect every chatbot conversation that has been handed over to an agent, and even if we do that, that does not grant us visibility of the API calls that might have failed in conversations where the chat was not handed over to an agent.I hope Zendesk will consider providing this type of reporting in the future.",Feedback - Reporting and analytics (Explore)

Vinicius Maioralli,Taxa de Resolução de Chatbot por Whatsapp - Whatsapp Chatbot Resolution Rate,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/5944495694746-Taxa-de-Resolu%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-Chatbot-por-Whatsapp-Whatsapp-Chatbot-Resolution-Rate,07/19/2023,"Olá. No Chatbot de Whatsapp que construi para a minha empresa, inclui diversos links de artigos, todos criados pelo Zendesk Guide, dentro de cada caixinha de texto que tinha sentido com o que o cliente estava querendo naquele momento. Ou seja, se o cliente precisa resetar a senha de login, ele acessar em um dos botões ""Reset de senha"", o Bot manda um artigo do Guide ensinando a resetar a senha e o cliente consegue finalizar o atendimento pelo botão ""Encerrar Atendimento"". Porém, quando eu tento buscar a informação de quais artigos estão resolvendo mais tickets, não consigo rastrear, pois como o botão ""Encerrar Atendimento"" tem o mesmo nome para todas as finalizações pós envio e recebimento do artigo, a contabilização feita pelo Explore acaba trazendo uma contagem de cliques em todos os botões que tem esse mesmo nome. Por isso, daqui para frente vou criar botões com nomes diferentes e gerenciar quais botões se referem a quais artigos.Hello. In the WhatsApp chatbot I built for my company, I included various article links created using Zendesk Guide within each text box that made sense to the customer's needs at that moment. So, if a customer needs to reset their login password, they can access one of the ""Password Reset"" buttons, and the bot will send an article from the Guide explaining how to reset the password. The customer can then finish the interaction by clicking the ""End Interaction"" button. However, when I try to track which articles are resolving the most tickets, I'm unable to do so because the ""End Interaction"" button has the same name for all the interactions after sending and receiving the article. This causes the counting done by Explore to include clicks on all buttons with the same name. Therefore, going forward, I will create buttons with different names and manage which buttons correspond to which articles.",Feedback - Reporting and analytics (Explore)

Jahn Bronilla,Scheduled Delivery - Report,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/5916210656282-Scheduled-Delivery-Report,07/11/2023,"Related to this post What happens if a scheduled dashboard delivery is set for the 31st?We used to send end of month report which is currently set every 31st of the month but the problem is per post, it will skipped the month that does not have 31 days which is quite frustrating specially stakeholders needed this report.Workaround are as follows:1. Either manually extracting the report every end of month which is not convenient and defeats the purpose of this scheduled delivery.2. Set the schedule every 30th of the month which will also affect the month of February.Is there a chance Zendesk can add option Monthly>End of Month instead of the specific date.

KROB,Messaging Dataset - Explore Attribute for Updater,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/5897169737498-Messaging-Dataset-Explore-Attribute-for-Updater,07/05/2023,"The messaging dataset has an attribute for assignee, but this does not get us the correct data we need if the ticket is reassigned to another agent or group. We use this info to calculate productivity, so this means the credit is going to the wrong agent if the ticket has to be reassigned to another agent or group to be worked. We can use some of the stats in the tickets dataset to get some of what we need, but we also need to see more specific data related to messages sent, like average assignment time, resolution time, and reply time. We cannot accurately report on this data for each agent without having an attribute that ensures the report is basing it on the updater and not the assignee. It should be more similar to the chat dataset, which did allow us to pull this data for the correct agent based on the agent who was serving the customer.",Feedback - Reporting and analytics (Explore)

Other details such as when they subscribed or other activity would be a plus.Description/Use Cases:Our company hosts a monthly webinar for users subscribed to a specific topic in Gather. We send email invitations to this group of users prior to the webinar. Today, there is no easy way in Explore to report on who those users are.As a workaround, I have to defer to the API to GET the users subscribed to this topic, parse out the user IDs, and run another API call (runner in Postman) to GET the user names and emails. After that, I do some spreadsheet magic to extract the user's email domains and associate them with their organization names.As you can see, the ability to get a list of names and emails of users subscribed to a particular topic is a very manual and time-consuming process that requires in-depth technical knowledge, let alone allowing access to the API which if not used correctly, could lead to unintended consequences.We are seeking a way for Community managers to report on this data without the need to run API calls since not all community managers have the technical depth to build and run APIs. I hope this makes sense.Business impact of limitation or missing feature:This is currently a blocker for some of our Community managers who are not tech-savvy and hurts productivity. This task is reduced to only a few folks who are knowledgeable and have access to Zendesk API for our instance and this API work around creates dependencies.",Feedback - Reporting and analytics (Explore)
