If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions.

This format is meant to help our PM’s get the most information from you to better understand and log your requests. This format will be rolled out at the end of 2023 and will be enforced as a requirement for all new posts to be logged and/or responded to by product managers.Example:TITLE: Pizza Order ButtonPlease give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.].

This feature is currently affecting my agents because they are hungry and my customers because they are dealing with hungry and grumpy agents.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agent team is working late and they are hungry, but the ticket queue is too high for any of them to leave and get pizza. This button would allow for a quick click, confirmation, and order without having to leave your desk. Customizable order templates for each employee would also be amazing!When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This problem happens on a daily basis. This is critical for our business as our agents get very hungry which affects their productivity and our customer satisfaction score.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Yes, my agents have to manually order pizza on their phones using a third party app.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)I would like to see an option to order pizza in the upper right hand corner of my screen, represented by a pizza emoji which, when I click it, will take me directly to an order form for my nearest pizza shop.

(2-3 sentences)I would like to be able to attach a photo to a Contact or Lead. I make 99% of my sales calls in person and it would be helpful to have a photo of someone I may have once before 9 months earlier. This issue affects end users who are prospecting in person and are getting older (my memory isn't what it used to be).What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)This would put a face to a name and increase the ease of initiating a conversation. I have hundreds of contacts in a three state territory.About a week ago I was calling on private Christian collleges and made some new contacts. It would be difficult for me to pic these folks out of a crowd because after a while everyone begins to look familiar. Having a pic that I could glance at on my mobile phone would increase my confidence going into meetings.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)No real workaround except maybe using their facebook or linkedin url to see a photo.What would be your ideal solution to this problem?

App will update the Due Date time located in the ticket’s custom field when initiated by the user.One of the issues that we face is that we want to update the ticket at the right time even if the user is not logged in. This is because the app currently works as a background app and user needs to be logged in for the process to work.What I have in mind is to use ZIS. Can I use ZIS to update these tickets even when user is not logged in?I am thinking of running ZIS every minute to search for matching ticket custom fields with the current date time and update them accordingly.Also, if we would use ZIS, is it possible to invoke the “notify” function to the logged in user using ZIS?Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.Thanks.",Feedback - Apps & Integrations (Platform)

Nawed Farooque,ZIS flow working with multiple variables in a transform action ,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6428511732378-ZIS-flow-working-with-multiple-variables-in-a-transform-action-,11/27/2023,"Hey all,I've build a flow to update the phone identities of a user if specific custom fields have been changed.What I did so far is, that I get the previous custom field value (e.g. +49 030123), it is the value of the variable: $.input.user_event.previous and with that I call the identities endpoint and find out the identityID to make an update with the current value ($.input.user_event.current).That works very well so far with these expression:""expr"": '.identities[] | select(.value == ""+49 030123"") | .id | tostring',Now I would like to use not the hardcoded number, rather the variable itself -> $.input.user_event.previous and my code looks like this:""find_phone"": {     ""Type"": ""Action"",     ""ActionName"": ""zis:common:transform:Jq"",     ""Parameters"": {      ""data.$"": ""$.identities"",      ""expr"": '.identities[] | select(.value == ""{{$.input.user_event.previous}}"") | .id | tostring',     },     ""ResultPath"": ""$.identity"",     ""Next"": ""Ok""    },But it doesn't work, it seems that the previous variable is blank. It works only with a hardcoded value. So it seems that it is not possible to access to the input variable because the expression is within the data parameter $.identity (which is the API output of all identities of an user).I am totally confused because if I use just a message to log it, works. My code looks like this:""Ok"": {""Type"": ""Succeed"",""Message"": ""Phone need to be change. ID: {{$.identity}} Value: {{$.input.user_event.previous}}""}Does the transform action need the input variable as a second parameter to access to it? How can I handle it?Thanks in advance",Feedback - Apps & Integrations (Platform)

Ideally, we would like the ability to either re-order how the Issue Typesare displayed or restrict the Issue Types available within the Zendesk Jira app modal.Description/Use Cases:There are various posts I have come across (#1, #2) requesting the ability to restrict the Issue Types available when users log a Jira via the integration in Zendesk. The primary reason is that you may not want to give a Support Agent logging a ticket the option to create a Jira for certain types (Epics, Tasks, etc.). In our business, there is a requirement that any Jira's logged via Zendesk should be set to Bugs. This is sometimes missed as the order of the Issue Scheme in Jira is set to Task first.Having the ability to re-order or restrict the types available (per project) in the Zendesk Jira UI would help minimise the risk of this happening.Other necessary information or resources:I appreciate that workarounds are available (using Jira automations, modifying the scheme), I believe having greater functionality available within the integration itself would help improve how it works.",Feedback - Apps & Integrations (Platform)

If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours.

However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics.

If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning.

Consequently, we can't route tickets which were created initially from an incoming call, as if it was an email ticket. These tickets are not calls anymore and shouldn't be identified as Calls.Example: Agent A answered to an incoming call but this call needs to be escalated to Agent B. Agent B is currently not available. Thus, Agent A needs to desynchronize the call. Agent A finishes the call with the customer and assign this ticket to Agent B. Afterwards, as soon as the Agent B comes back, the ticket can't be routed to them because Agent B is available via email only and not for Calls. This is a big limitation here, because even if the Agent B is Online for Calls, they will receive these tickets with completed calls, one by one, instead of getting assigned these tickets according to their capacity. As I said, these tickets are not calls anymore and should be routed according to the Email capacity not Call capacity.",Feedback - Voice (Talk)

However, when it comes to interacting with an IVR system during a call that requires input, we find that the keyboard functionality is not available. Main use case, calling into a Zoom room. The only way to navigate through the IVR system is to use the mouse to click the buttons on the dialer.While this method gets the job done, it is significantly slower compared to using a keyboard. As you know, in a customer support environment, every second matters. The time difference between using a mouse click and a keyboard can impact our customer service delivery and overall productivity.I am sure that other members of the Zendesk community also share this concern. I believe that extending keyboard support to the whole process in the Zendesk Talk Dialer, especially during IVR interactions, would greatly enhance the user experience and service efficiency.We would greatly appreciate it if the Zendesk team could take this feedback into serious consideration and provide a response regarding potential solutions or planned updates to address this issue.Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.",Feedback - Voice (Talk)

Hold length, Time between calls (idle/available timer), total call length are all possible data points/metrics to display in this live call timer.Description/Use Case:In many call centers, agents are held to specific timings for Average Handle Time/Call Duration and other call statuses such as Hold Length. A timer that is displayed to the ZenDesk agent in real time would help the agent track durations and be more effective with their call control and productivity.A timer function already exists for incoming calls to display how long the caller has been waiting, and this functionality could be expanded to support things such as:Total Call LengthHold LengthMute LengthAvailable time between callsAgents frequently use hold as time to research a caller's question or issue, or to contact a higher tier support agent for assistance. The current experience for ZenDesk agents requires them to manually track this time via another method in additional to completing the task the Hold is being used for.Business impact of limitation or missing featureCall Centers or Customer Support teams typically have goals set for Average Handle Time (Call Length) and Time that the caller is allowed to be on hold (Hold Time). Many times things like hold times are monitored per hold and per call, for example, you can have a customer on hold for 6 minutes per call, but only 2 minutes at a time before checking in. I have seen this feature on many other softphone products and would love to see it in ZenDesk.This timer feature would support this standard practice, keep a more positive experience for the caller, and improve productivity for ZenDesk agents.

So wait time reports were truly inclusive of live wait time and voicemail wait time to receive a callback. In addition the call center software treated a callback and voicemail as one in the same. So the caller could leave a callback/voicemail which would hold their place in the queue. So when an agent became available, the callback/voicemail was given to them to act on. In Zendesk it seems that a callback is just a phone number waiting in the queue, so when the agent becomes available, they don't know what the call is about so they cannot prepare. And a voicemail just becomes a ticket which now relies on agents to manually go and check on.It would be great if ZD would provide the option for a callback and voicemail be one in the same and waiting in the queue.

Don't worry, if your post should be in another topic, the Zendesk Community Team will move your post to the correct topic.Here are a few guidelines on how to use the Product Feedback topic, so that our Product team can effectively use and apply your feedback to our product planning process:Follow the Community Code of ConductFeedback and constructive criticism are welcome. Disparaging, harassing, mean, or snarky remarks about Zendesk, its employees, vendors, partners, or other community members will not be tolerated. We’re all friends and professionals, so let’s keep it polite. We don’t like having to remove comments, but we reserve the right to do so without warning in order to maintain a positive community experience for everyone.If it's a bug, contact supportThis topic is for sharing ideas about the product. If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions. We value all feedback and we're happy to have a place to engage in these conversations.",Feedback - Help Center (Guide)

Dan Cooper,Guide Team Publishing API Endpoints,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6482703860506-Guide-Team-Publishing-API-Endpoints,12/12/2023,"Please give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.]. (2-3 sentences)The Guide API has some significant gaps related to being able to view team publishing statuses, archived content, and being able to manage owner/template status. As you go deeper with Guide you start needing more powerful workflows and while most of Zendesk has a rich API, Guide doesn't give many options to fill in gaps. Some specific issues we've run into over time include not being able to set owners or templates on articles, not being able to properly assign content updates to staff (you can only notify the assignee and there is no comment history), we can't systematically archive/restore content, and we can't establish custom workflows that allow us to manage review status for content teams that don't directly work in Zendesk but collaborate with Zendesk users.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)It would be great if Zendesk could solve all of our problems, but priorities happen, and it would be great if we had the ability to build solutions that allowed us to capitalize on the things that Zendesk has done right. When Zendesk can't prioritize some features, we can. In a conversation of build vs buy, sometimes the only option is buy elsewhere.When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This used to be a daily issue for us, but there has been so little movement that we've had to move onto other workflows that are worse because of it. We want to use Zendesk, but it's difficult to onboard teams that aren't Zendesk primary and we don't have great options to fill in the gaps to allow those teams to really get into Zendesk content management. This has lead to many conversations with teams to load content into Zendesk that have fizzled out or become stagnant because the built in workflows don't cut it. Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Most of our primary use cases just don't use Zendesk despite an attempt to do so. We have to have staff chase down content updates and owners over time because owners and notifications aren't easily maintained in a way that is effective for us.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)Give us new endpoints to do what we can today, but with a path for us to build the workflows that work best for us.Article endpoints should include the ability to read and set the owner and templateAdd team publishing endpoints for Set Article Review Status, Assign Article, List TasksAdd Schedule article publicationendpointAdd List/Restore/Delete Archived Article endpoints.These would give us the ability to create workflows that can let us establish consistent Zendesk workflows around owner and templates used in a UI that we control. We could allow for article content to be pulled into another system for review workflows with non-Zendesk teams and allow for us to push status updates back to Zendesk. For article assignment, it would give us the ability to track comment threads on an article absent an option in Zendesk.I understand there are other initiatives in progress at Zendesk that may negate some of the pain points above, but it would be great to see some API level options for past and new Guide features to let us do more with the product.",Feedback - Help Center (Guide)

(2-3 sentences)When using the ""Replace media"" feature, we would like a way to prevent the new image from publishing immediately. This issue affects our agents because we are often staging UI updates in our help desk before our system is officially updated, so publishing the new image immediately isn't conducive to our needs. It's affecting our customers because they need the information in our help desk to match our live UI.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agents need to be able to complete work ahead of time so that they're not scrambling to update all of our articles after our system updates go live. Being able to queue image updates would ensure that our updates are timely and that our customers aren't waiting for accurate documentation.When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)We update our system every two weeks. I was trying to update an article last week, and I was excited by the Replace Media feature until I realized that the new image was published immediately. Because that new functionality isn't live yet, I had to go back into the article, find the old image, replace the new one with the old one, re-publish with the old image, then upload the new image (without using the Replace Image feature), so that I could queue up a draft with the new image. The result was a lot of extra work plus superfluous images in our system that will need to be removed once the update is live.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem?

Not having a production copy in the sandbox greatly impacts the ability to test bot an AI functionality. The new generative AI functionality needs to be able to pull information from Guide when suggesting solutions to customers. Re-creating a handful of articles in the sandbox version of Guide does not allow for large scale, production comparable validation testing. Not having this feature is forcing us to do validation testing of the bot and generative AI functionality in production.

Seeing the ""out of"" count makes me unlikely to bother reading the article, even if it contains the answer I need.Problem 2: ""Unhelpful"" votes are ultimately unhelpful and not actionable for admins.Although I can pull a report with my ""helpful"" and ""unhelpful"" votes on any given article, this data is utterly useless because it leaves me blindly guessing about why a customer voted negatively on an article.Is the article too long? Not long enough? Is it missing a key piece of information? Is there a broken link in my content? Was the article published in the wrong section? Is the labeling and keywording poorly optimized? Is the customer simply clicking ""unhelpful"" because they're having a bad day? — I have no idea, because I have zero insight into why a user voted the article as ""unhelpful.""Admins should be able to: Toggle off the ""out of"" portion of the vote count on articles, so that only ""x found this helpful"" displays to End Users.Gather additional feedback from users who vote articles as ""unhelpful,"" including:- A comment body (reportable in Explore) and - (optional to End User) the User fields to collect name + email address, which gives us the opportunity to follow up with the user if needed.There are half a dozen user-submitted guides in the Community about how to do these things with custom code, but most are many years old and unfortunately none of those custom solutions work as of Nov 2023. Additionally, we can't get Zendesk Support's assistance on this because at this time, the goal is considered too custom.These features are basic requirements for any Help Center feedback module; they really should be included in Guide natively.TL;DR: Article votes should not actively amplify negative perceptions about our articles or our brand — and — if negative votes are not actionable, negative vote counts have no practical purpose.",Feedback - Help Center (Guide)

Zendesk is incompliant with worldwide best practices.Bearing in mind many companies have their employees spread all over the world in various offices, effective knowledge sharing becomes vital.However, with Zendesk forcing drafts to be unsearchable, we had to choose either to delay the knowledge sharing between internal users (employees) or to publish the unverified content to external users (customers).Who affected: both customers and all employees.How often we're affected: each day.Known workaround: use a third-party solution to make drafts searchable according to the selected visibility permissions (Visible to).Ideal solution: Make a checkbox called ""Make drafts searchable"" that will be controlled by Guide admins, so each company may adjust the workflow according to their needs.",Feedback - Help Center (Guide)

I've chosen it as my homepage due to its intuitive, elegant, and functional design. In addition, the wide range of tools that Zendesk offers is impressively robust. I still remember the days when the most recommended service was less than $29 a month. Even though it has now increased to $99 with an upfront annual subscription, I continue to believe that what Zendesk provides far exceeds anything I could develop on my own.I would like to suggest an improvement. It would be greatly beneficial if, in the public view of GUIDE, those articles that are private and marked with a security icon could be displayed, especially if they have catchy titles that would surely grab the attention of visitors. I'm convinced that many would feel encouraged to register and log in upon seeing that these contents are available once they've authenticated. Seeing a screen full of options is undoubtedly more appealing than just seeing a few articles highlighting the benefits of registration.Public article #1 🅿️Public article #2 🅿️Great title for users who have logged in 👮🏻‍♀️Magnificent title for users who have logged in 👮🏻‍♀️The best title for users who have logged in 👮🏻‍♀️In the age of AI, everyone highlights 'Do you want early access?'. Living beings' curiosity is truly remarkable. Give a mouse a piece of cheese, and next, it'll ask for a glass of milk.I suggest displaying good titles of private articles with security icons in public view of GUIDE should encourage registrations and logins.

Erin McDougal,Content tags should be separated by brand,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6009021203482-Content-tags-should-be-separated-by-brand,08/07/2023,"Feature Request Summary:Content tags should not be shared across brands. Content tags should be unique by brand to allow for a better customer and agent experience choosing from the list of content tags.Description/Use Cases:Our company has several brands in Zendesk, all representing unique product offerings to distinct customer bases. Because our products are different enough in functionality, the content tags need to be different to reflect those distinct use cases. For example, one product would have tags like Appointment Scheduling, Kiosk, and Alerts. Another product would have tags like Data Administration, Imports and Exports, and Dashboards. Displaying content tags from all brands to all customers is a very confusing experience, when they don't have access to that functionality in their brand, nor do they really recognize the names of different brands. This means we are not able to expose content tags to our end users, and they cannot add them to their Community posts themselves.Business impact of limitation or missing feature:Without content tags being split by brands, we cannot use this feature in more than one brand, which basically makes it unusable. The big benefit for us is in customers being able to add their own content tags to their Community posts, and we cannot allow it in a multiple brand environment.",Feedback - Help Center (Guide)

However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers.

This format is meant to help our PM’s get the most information from you to better understand and log your requests. This format will be rolled out at the end of 2023 and will be enforced as a requirement for all new posts to be logged and/or responded to by product managers.Example:TITLE: Pizza Order ButtonPlease give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.]. (2-3 sentences)I would like to be able to order a pizza from my favorite restaurant directly by opening a Z2 ticket. This feature is currently affecting my agents because they are hungry and my customers because they are dealing with hungry and grumpy agents.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agent team is working late and they are hungry, but the ticket queue is too high for any of them to leave and get pizza. This button would allow for a quick click, confirmation, and order without having to leave your desk. Customizable order templates for each employee would also be amazing!When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This problem happens on a daily basis. This is critical for our business as our agents get very hungry which affects their productivity and our customer satisfaction score.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Yes, my agents have to manually order pizza on their phones using a third party app.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)I would like to see an option to order pizza in the upper right hand corner of my screen, represented by a pizza emoji which, when I click it, will take me directly to an order form for my nearest pizza shop. It would be great if the system could remember my previous order and use that data to speed up the ordering process.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

(2-3 sentences)I would like to be able to utilize the new auto-accept functionality for live chat. We're unable to utilize this new feature until a reassignment functionality is added. Reassignment currently exists and works as expected when not using auto-accept. Reassignment (Reasignment Timeout & Chats Reassigned) are key chat routing settings that we can't live without.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agents often forget to change their statuses to Invisible at the end of their shift, leading to chats routing to agents who aren't actually available to take the chat. Auto assigning chats with no reassignment rules will lead to customers being assigned to an unavailable agent with no reply. This would be an unacceptable customer experience.When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)Support reps forgetting to change their status at the end of a shift is almost a daily occurrence.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)We are currently using chat without the auto-accept functionality. We would like to use the auto-accept functionality, but only if re-assignment is added.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function?

Atanas Tomov,Product Feedback: Messaging authentication limitation,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6520601639834-Product-Feedback-Messaging-authentication-limitation,12/21/2023,"Hello,The main limitation in this topic is accounts in Zendesk can have only one External ID. Currently whenever an end-user requests a messaging conversation and is authenticated, an account with External ID is created and if there is more than 1 brand - this creates additional accounts which then have to be merged into the main e-mail account. If for example, the end-user has social channels as well (like Facebook, X corp. etc.), this generates more accounts.A solution for this would mean a unified account which will improve agent experience.This impacts us on a daily basis and as a workaround, it is possible to utilize API calls to merge accounts, however this is not ideal as it can be done only with lower traffic and there is a limit to how much API calls we can make and they can be utilized more efficiently elsewhere. As a workaround of the workaround, we can get an API calls add-on, however it will have to be free of charge.An ideal solution for this would be to remove External ID as unique identified and make it the same as in Chat product.Thank you.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

We don't mind the continuous conversation, we just need to create a new ticket when the issue is different.For our use cases we must track every ticket with the associated order number, which means that we need a ticket for every order number, we can't have 1 ticket with mixed order numbers, as we will loose traceability that is very important for us. For us the order number is a custom field that is essential in each one of our workflows.Let's say that:User ""ABC"" starts a messaging conversation related to order ""123"" and ticket ""001"" is created. Ticket ""001"" is responded via email by the agent, because it can't be resolved via messaging as it requires an escalation to third party via side conversation. The ticket will be solved once we have the response via the third party. Ticket ""001"" must remain associated to order ""123!""The same user ""ABC"" engage again in a messaging conversation related this time to a different order ""333"", this will reopen the same messaging ticket ""001"", which was related to order number ""123"". This will overwrite the order ""123"" with the order ""333"". This is why in this instance a new ticket must be created different from ""001"".Our need is therefore a simple trigger or a mechanism that allows the user to continue enjoying the continuous conversation, but from an ticketing agent point of view we need to create a new ticket when the issue is related to a different order number or another issue.Why this is important?Every ticket is associated to an order number, and every order number must be stored for reporting and most importantly every order needs an escalation to a third party which will change based on the order number, this cannot be solved in seconds it may require from 24 to 48 hours to resolve the ticket.Is there any solution that allows creating a new ticket when the issue is different?Thanks",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

As we are all working remotely, we have encountered a common problem – no sound alerts for incoming chats/conversation. Instead, we solely rely on the notification bubble that displays the number of message assigned to an agent. We just recently switched workspaces and our chats are now in conversations.I reached out to Zendesk support, and after some back and forth, they confirmed something interesting. It turns out we only get chat sounds when our routing is set to ""Broadcast."" Unfortunately for us, as we are using the ""Assigned"" chat route, there are no incoming chat sounds. Chat sounds are only heard when the chat has been accepted, and the agent is looking at another tab and the customer replies to the conversation.This situation makes multitasking more challenging for our agents. They need to continuously monitor the Zendesk tab to detect if there's a chat assigned to them. So, we're really hoping for a quick fix here. It's impacting our team's ability to stay on top of things and be as efficient as we'd like.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

It seems that even the smallest changes can sometimes take a while to implement in Zendesk.However, there are some complications associated with adding images using the ""Send message"" feature. It's important to note that the error I'll be pointing out doesn't occur with images added through the ""Add carousel"" option.If we use ""Send message"" and add a picture in this step there are problems.The problem described from a developer's perspective is that customers/visitors may expect to be directed to a specific page when they click on the image, especially when presented with the option to ""Open in a new window."" that Zendesk has put on top if you hover the image in the bot window.However, in the given scenario, clicking on the image only opens a larger version of the image, which can lead to confusion. And all in all that is just bad UI design.To address this issue, there are a couple of potential solutions. One option would be to include a link we could put in the back-end - to have desired effect of having the image directing the customers to the desired page. Just the same as if we added a button below to take the customer there. This way, when visitors click on the image, they will be redirected to the intended destination rather than just viewing a larger version of the image.Alternatively, if incorporating a link within the image is not feasible or desired, another solution could be to remove the click ability of the image altogether and also the ""Open in a new window"" promp on hover. By removing the ability to click on the image, it would eliminate any confusion or expectation of being directed to a different page.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

If a user asks the question ""How do I make my design accessible"" No accessibility related articles. Instead numerous completely unrelated articles are provided simply because the word ""Design"" is included in them.I guess what this boils down to is there doesn't seem to be a way for me to tell the messaging bot specifically to ignore common words, in our case, the word ""design"".And yes I realize the best option here is to craft an answer for the bot if I know I want to target the accessible intent. The problem surfaces for lesser known intents we don't have crafted answers for yet and the negative user experience customers receive when chatting with the bot.I'll also highlight that this is NOT the case for email article recommendations. The email auto reply suggestions actually handle this MUCH better and customers get the articles that make sense.I hope that makes sense? TLDR, we have a broadly used keyword that seems to be too heavily weighted causing completely inaccurate recommendations within messaging.",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

A crucial feature pertaining to WhatsApp automation appears to have been removed.In the classic module, we were afforded the capability to generate ticket assignments based on the ""country code."" This allowed the agent responsible for the region associated with that phone number to provide customer service. Regrettably, this feature is absent in the new Zendesk system.I have previously lodged a complaint by opening a ticket regarding this matter, but to no avail; no solution was provided. The absence of this feature significantly increases the amount of manual work required to allocate tickets to the appropriate agents.If there is no foreseeable solution to this feature deficiency, we will have to consider migrating to another customer service platform.I am hopeful that Zendesk will address this concern swiftly, considering the significant impact it has on our operational efficiency.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Classic zendesk (when it worked)",Feedback - Chat and Messaging (Chat)

We love hearing about how you use our tools and what would make them better. This guide is here to help you understand how the product feedback process works, and how to write an effective feedback post. You may also want to check out this short video on giving product feedback at Zendesk.This topic is for product feedback about the ticketing system. Don't worry, if your post should be in another topic, the Zendesk Community Team will move your post to the correct topic.Here are a few guidelines on how to use the Product Feedback topic, so that our Product team can effectively use and apply your feedback to our product planning process:Follow the Community Code of ConductFeedback and constructive criticism are welcome. Disparaging, harassing, mean, or snarky remarks about Zendesk, its employees, vendors, partners, or other community members will not be tolerated. We’re all friends and professionals, so let’s keep it polite. We don’t like having to remove comments, but we reserve the right to do so without warning in order to maintain a positive community experience for everyone.If it's a bug, contact supportThis topic is for sharing ideas about the product. If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions. We value all feedback and we're happy to have a place to engage in these conversations.",Feedback - Community Forums (Gather)

I like to be able to create subtopics. Especially as long as Zendesk doesn't offer country-specific Communities, we need subtopics. Here's why:Zendesk's current solution is to use topics to localize the Community. Meaning, we create a topic called ""Germany"", another called ""UK"", and so on. But then the user clicks on the topic and lands directly in the list of posts. But the user should see subtopics that cover the actual topics, like 'General FAQ' or 'Product Requests'. Without subtopics, there is no way to include the actual topics if you have already used the topics for localization.",Feedback - Community Forums (Gather)

The email text doesn’t generate the thankfulness or excitement we feel when granting these badges.

Following the announcementregarding the transition to the new Explore dashboard builder, we've revised our plan and put together this post to give you a comprehensive overview and address any concerns you might have.Connect with us liveBefore we delve into the transition details, we invite you to join us at our PM Roundtable on November 2, 2023. This live session provides an excellent opportunity for you to connect with our product team, ask questions, share your feedback, and learn more about the exciting features and improvements the New Dashboard Builder brings to your Zendesk experience. We look forward to seeing you there!Why is Zendesk making this change?The move is driven by our commitment to simplifying how dashboards are built. Many of you shared how the classic experience has a steep learning curve. With the new dashboard builder, we want to provide a flexible, user-tailored experience that gives control and visibility to editors. This new experience represents our commitment to empowering you to create dashboards you're proud to share.Transition processThe transition will take place using a phased approach over a 12-month period to help you prepare and adapt to the new interface gradually – starting with the General Availability (GA) of the new dashboard builder, currently planned to launch no sooner than Q1 2024.You can rest assured that Zendesk will notify account owners and administrators via email before the GA date, with reminders along the way. We will also share a detailed timeline with more information about what you can expect in each phase to guide you through this change. In the meantime, here is a high-level overview of the transition plan:Phase 1 - Beta dashboard builder GA release (4 months): The GA release of our new dashboard builder will include a host of exciting features like tabs, exports, schedules, and the ability to link filters across different datasets.During this phase, while users have the option to continue using the classic builder, it's important to note that our primary focus will be on the development and improvement of the new dashboard builder. As a result, there will be certain limitations for those continuing with the classic experience:Only highly impactful bugs will be fixed in the classic builderNo enhancements will be made to the classic builderPhase 2 - Transitionary period (4 months): Following the GA release of the new dashboard builder, there will be a transitionary period of approximately four months.During this time, you’ll still be able to edit your dashboards using the classic builder, but you won’t be able to create brand-new dashboards with it. This transitionary period will enable you to gradually adapt to the new interface and take advantage of its enhanced capabilities at your own pace.At this stage, you’ll also know how your shared dashboards are being used and will be able to identify the relevant dashboards you want to rebuild using the new dashboard builder.Phase 3 - View-only access to classic dashboards (4 months): After the transitionary period concludes, dashboards built with the classic builder will remain accessible to all users who have access, but the capabilities will be limited to view-only mode, as edit access to the classic builder will be removed. View-only mode for dashboards built in the classic builder will remain in place for another four months.Retirement of the classic view-only experience: In order to be transparent about our future plans, four (4) months after the start of the ""View-only access to classic dashboards"" phase, we will fully retire the classic dashboard. This means that the classic dashboard will no longer be available for use after this period.This phased approach is represented in the visual below.Your questions answeredFollowing the original announcement, you also raised a number of questions. We've addressed the most common questions below:Has phase 1 already started?No, this plan is set to start after the general availability (GA) of the beta builder.When is the GA of the beta builder planned?While we don’t have yet a firm date, it won’t be earlier than Q1 2024.Will there be a tool to help in migrating dashboards built with the classic builder?Yes, we are developing a tool that will allow you to quickly import reports from an existing dashboard built with the classic builder. While we don’t have an ETA yet, this tool will be available before the beginning of phase 3.What is the timeframe for accessing existing dashboards created with the classic builder?You will be able to access the existing dashboards created with the classic builder until the end of phase 3, which marks the retirement of the classic view-only experience. This phase is expected to occur approximately one year after the GA of the new dashboard builder.What features will be available at GA?Many of the features you’ve requested will be available, including:Exports in CSV, Excel, and PDF formatScheduled dashboards and dashboard restrictionsTabsLinked filters across different datasetsExcluding reports from being filteredClick hereto learn more about what features will be available at each stage.Will bookmarks be available?Bookmarks or a similar feature will be available post-GA.We recognize that bookmarks serve many important use cases. At the same time, they introduced some inconsistencies when applied across different tabs, as one bookmark could potentially override another one, causing the exposure of unnecessary data.We are working on preventing these behaviors from happening in the future while supporting the same functionalities. At the same time, some of the most important use cases will be served before the GA through dashboard restrictions or other features.You can find a more detailed answer here.Are existing reports compatible with the new builder?Yes, all existing reports are compatible with the new builder.Will you delete existing reports after the retirement of the classic view-only experience?No, we won’t. Your existing reports will be accessible via the report builder and new dashboard builder and won’t be impacted by this plan.Can you provide some guidance on how to migrate dashboards?A future article will guide you through the steps you can take to simplify this transition.At a very high level, you will be able to:Identify your most-used dashboardsDetermine whether any of them are similar enough that they would be good candidates to be combined into a single dashboard with dashboard restrictionsUse the importer tool to quickly import reports from an existing dashboardWill Professional Services be available to rebuild dashboards?Yes, they will be available as a paid service. We will share more details about their availability and pricing after the GA.How is this different from migrating from Insights?It is very different as you won’t have to rebuild any reports. Instead, you can quickly import the existing ones to a new dashboard.Your feedback matters: Join the roundtablePlease share your thoughts in the comments below. We'll incorporate your feedback into continuous improvements to the new dashboard builder.If you're interested in participating in a deeper conversation about this change, please join our PM Roundtable on November 2, 2023, where we’ll walk through the plan, show some of the new features, and answer your questions.We're excited about the improvements the new dashboard builder brings and look forward to supporting you through this transition.

We love hearing about how you use our tools and what would make them better. This guide is here to help you understand how the product feedback process works, and how to write an effective feedback post. You may also want to check out this short video on giving product feedback at Zendesk.This topic is for product feedback about the ticketing system. Don't worry, if your post should be in another topic, the Zendesk Community Team will move your post to the correct topic.Here are a few guidelines on how to use the Product Feedback topic, so that our Product team can effectively use and apply your feedback to our product planning process:Follow the Community Code of ConductFeedback and constructive criticism are welcome. Disparaging, harassing, mean, or snarky remarks about Zendesk, its employees, vendors, partners, or other community members will not be tolerated. We’re all friends and professionals, so let’s keep it polite. We don’t like having to remove comments, but we reserve the right to do so without warning in order to maintain a positive community experience for everyone.If it's a bug, contact supportThis topic is for sharing ideas about the product. If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions. We value all feedback and we're happy to have a place to engage in these conversations.",Feedback - Reporting and analytics (Explore)

Nearly every dashboard I have for our organization utilizes this functionality. Change Attribute widgets allow you to see a time-series report (column or line, for example) by date, week, month, quarter, hour, etc., giving the user a lot of flexibility with reporting.I will typically build a report that uses a Date ([Ticket created - date], [Ticket solved - date], etc.) time attribute as the default, and then add a Change Attribute widget giving the user flexibility to view the metrics by those other divisions of time given an associated date range (e.g.: last 12 weeks by week, last 6 months by month, 4 quarters by quarter).The change attribute is extremely useful in other ways. For example, you can build group custom attributes that are sub-sets of longer lists of custom field values or agent names, and then change attributes can be used to update a set of reports to show a different portion of the data, or as a way to change your aspect perspective of the data (kind of like decomposing, but not drilling). I find this workflow to be a little more intuitive than using data filters.Is this feature being considered for inclusion with the new dashboard builder at all? I'm under the impression that eventually we're getting kicked off the classic builder altogether. There are lots of other great features in classic (for design / layout) that I'm really sad to have to abandon.",Feedback - Reporting and analytics (Explore)

We tried using Explore to meet our needs. The good news, you can filter by group, bad news, it requires extra clicks. In addition to that, the main issue that one needs to drill in to see breakdown by agent.

Porém, quando eu tento buscar a informação de quais artigos estão resolvendo mais tickets, não consigo rastrear, pois como o botão ""Encerrar Atendimento"" tem o mesmo nome para todas as finalizações pós envio e recebimento do artigo, a contabilização feita pelo Explore acaba trazendo uma contagem de cliques em todos os botões que tem esse mesmo nome.

In the WhatsApp chatbot I built for my company, I included various article links created using Zendesk Guide within each text box that made sense to the customer's needs at that moment. So, if a customer needs to reset their login password, they can access one of the ""Password Reset"" buttons, and the bot will send an article from the Guide explaining how to reset the password. The customer can then finish the interaction by clicking the ""End Interaction"" button. However, when I try to track which articles are resolving the most tickets, I'm unable to do so because the ""End Interaction"" button has the same name for all the interactions after sending and receiving the article. This causes the counting done by Explore to include clicks on all buttons with the same name.

We send email invitations to this group of users prior to the webinar.

If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours.

These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen.

If the email address is inserted as a ""mail to"" link then the above line is NOT removed from the ticket. I believe this is a bug. The line should be removed either way. The issue is that Outlook seems to render an email address as a link even when the link attribute is explicitly removed.2) If the nominated requester's email address is not found in the customer database then a new customer is added with the name set as the username section of the nominated email. In the above case, the requester's name would be set to ""john.doe"". This is unsightly and looks unprofessional. It can be changed via the support portal. However, it would be an improvement if a name in addition to an email address could be defined in the #requester tag.

(2-3 sentences)Hello, our workflows frequently undergo updates, necessitating revisions to our information knowledge bases (IKBs) and macros. These updates often need to be executed overnight or outside regular business hours to align with the operating hours of our vendors. Presently, this is impacting our content team, requiring them to log in during late hours to implement these updates.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Implementing this will enhance our team's efficiency by enabling content creators to work within their designated hours while ensuring live updates occur outside regular business hours. For instance, when campaigns launch overnight, the team working during those hours will require the updated content during their operational time.When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)As recently as last week, our content team logged in at midnight to ensure the latest campaign updates were available for the overnight team, a process that recurs several times annually. Without these updates, the agents handling tickets would lack accurate information crucial for assisting our customers.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Currently our solution involves the content team operating beyond their regular business hours to ensure the accuracy of IKBs and macros. We've streamlined the process by scheduling posts to the teams via Slack, leaving only Zendesk requiring direct login for these updates.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)In an ideal scenario, we aim to have the capability to schedule these updates within Zendesk itself.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

In many cases we need to alternate many hundreds of times a year. Inevitably there will be some human error in mistakenly forgetting to select ""internal"" and sending a potentially sensitive email to the customer.I guarantee if I had the option to keep all internal threads vertically isolated from external threads, it would be far more intuitive for me to ensure the communication goes to the correct person. This would reduce the chances of human error coming into play as no separate action needs to be taken, we would simply be replying in the same area where the previous communication came from. It would be fundamentally counter-intuitive for me to send a reply to an internal comment to an external customer.Humans will make mistakes and in some very sensitive situations the existing functionality I believe does not prevent human error sufficiently.

Also it increases the amount of work needed to just update our documentation on the changes (training/articles/macros etc)Automatic changes: When enabled/disabled Custom Ticket Statuses automatically updates triggers/automations/macros/views but does not list what it has updatedWe know what was changed but not which ones were updated thus we are shooting in the dark for getting articles updates/notes/training/screenshotsVisibility: Custom ticket statuses show for everyone in the instanceGroup/Brand based statuses are on roadmapReordering: You cannot change the order of the Ticket StatusesCustomization: We can't customize the status color or icon of a ticket statusMove between categories: You can't move statuses between categories once created. You would need to deactivate the status and create it again under the new categoryReporting: You cannot report on how long a ticket status has been in a state natively.There is a workaround with triggers adding tagsCharacter limit: There’s a 48 character limit for ticket status names. Ticket status names that are 35 characters or longer are truncated. We can't set how that looks visuallySolved/Closed category: Solved and Closed tickets are both under the Ticket Category of Solved which can be confusing for Agents that have views set up to look at solved and closed ticketsEntire ticket status visible in views: The entire Ticket Status becomes visible which means lengthy statuses can expand views into a scrollbarScrolling in statuses: If you have more than 10 active ticket statuses, the status picker will display the first 10 active ticket statuses. Agents will need to scroll down to see the restStatus deletion: You cannot delete a ticket status once it is createdAny tickets using the deactivated ticket status will still retain the statusNew Status: You cannot assign a Custom Status under the 'New' status categoryHide statuses: You can't hide statuses but still use them similar to New and Closed statusesWhat problem do you see this solving?More customization options, less confusion, less adjustment period, easier management of ticket statuses, better reporting - our jobs should not get harder with new featuresWhen was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business?We have not turned on statuses yet but we are going through testingAutomatic changes: We would need to do extensive information gathering to see exactly what is being changed (wording, triggers, etc) as we document a lot of processes and we would not want the data to be outdated when it comes to turning this onVisibility: We have multiple teams that have different needs and having to collaborate with them to agree on what statuses we have will not work. We would rather make no changes than make a change that will impact everyone (this impacts reporting which has high visibility)Reordering: Teams change their mind all the time on locations and having the statuses locked in on first go is very unlikely. We might find that it is hard to read or it doesn't make sense visually and so our options are to deactivate the status and recreate itCustomization: Our teams may want to have several Open types as many things could be happening on the ticket and if they are all the same color, they could click on the wrong ones which impacts reportingMove between categories: I can't see this happening too often but when it does, there may be tickets already assigned to the category so you need to deactivate, create new, then move tickets to the category (as long as not closed)Reporting: Teams are already asking about ticket history for the status and we are needing to get a list of statuses we want then start creating triggers just for the tags to be addedSolved/Closed category: When we turned this on in our sandbox, the very first question is how they can tell the difference between solved/closed. As such, we need to teach a fundamental change of how views will look going forward. Which means different processes/view updatesEntire ticket status visible in views: The visual appearance of views is already a lot of information and now to add entire statuses makes the views a lot more noisy. We have gotten complaints as views now have scrollbars due to length of statusScrolling in statuses: We are setting internal limits on how many statuses we have so we don't hit that scrollbarStatus deletion: Already made a mistake in adding in statuses as part of test - they will remain there until the end of timeNew status: I would like to be able to set different types of 'New' statuses. Like when it is a New ticket due to a follow up being created vrs a brand new interactionHide statuses: There are some statuses that we do not want Agents to be able to set. For example, when a ticket reopens due to being onhold, they shouldn't be able to set the ticket to be ""Open - due date"", instead a trigger should do it (like setting tickets to closed)Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain)There are no workarounds for the majority of the limitations - as such we are delaying turning on Custom tickets statuses until the last moment so that most of these can hopefully be addresses by then.Restrict by Brand/Group - on roadmapReporting on how long statuses - have to create triggers for each status and report on tags and not status (requires you to do this upon conception and to maintain the statuses/triggers)Status deletion - you can deactivate the statusReordering statuses/move status between categories - you have to deactivate a status or statuses then recreate it in the order you wantWhat would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function?Automatic changes: When enabled/disabled Custom Ticket Statuses automatically updates triggers/automations/macros/views. Have it display what triggers/views etc were adjusted. It would be even better if it was a spreadsheet that we can export to keep track of all changes made. Even for any articles with screenshots of previous views/statuses, we can replace those in articlesVisibility: Ability to set a Brand/group/form for each status (like contextual workspaces) so if it meets that condition, it will be displayedGroup/Brand based statuses are on roadmapReordering: Ability to drag and drop the status or have an option to 'select position' similar to how triggers used to be able to be rearrangedCustomization/Entire ticket status visible in views: Within the status, you can change the colors like you can font or include an icon.Previously, statuses were identified as N, O, P, H, S, C within a view - it would be nice to have the ability to set abbreviations or icons to help reduce the clutter/noise in a viewMove between categories: Similar to changing the order of the triggers, you can also move the triggers to a different category. Similar to Trigger CategoriesReporting: Within Explore, you can look at ticket history to see exactly how long a ticket was in certain statuses, who updated the status, and what statuses the ticket was inCharacter limit: I understand there needing to be a character limit but rather than forcing a truncation, having the ability to set how the status appears (appears on multiple lines, cuts off at this word, etc)Solved/Closed category: Having Closed be its own category so we can easily tell which ticket is closed and solved rather than looking at the bucket beside the subject - less visual confusionScrolling in statuses: I understand that having all statuses visible would be rather large and eventually it would need to scroll. However, if there was the ability to set nested statuses, this could reduce the need for scrolling. Or the ability to set if you want statuses to scroll or minimize the textStatus deletion: You should be able to delete a status. And if there are tickets associated with the status, then we should be able to set what status the tickets should be changed to OR have it retained by deactivating the statusNew statuses: Ability to add other options for New statuses for easier visibilityHide statuses: Ability to hide statuses but triggers can still action on them (like New, and Closed). There should be an option to hide from agents (just like end-users), deactivate or delete a status",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

We want to handle the requests by SLA first, but we also need to consider tickets that has no SLA set. In Zendesk SLAs are often based on comments, and some tickets have a SLA met but are still Open or new, and should be handled.We want to have better logic in place to e.g. weight on SLA first, but also consider the tickets that are new/open and based on for example their request date or custom date field, rank them higher. Today we'd have to use akward automations to update the data of these tickets. I wish we could have a better view defintion such as multiple sorting criteria or a sort expression, weighing different parameters to build the final View order.Use caseWe have process like two-party signing processes, where tickets are created in Zendesk early, but they don't need action from support until both parties has signed an agreement. We have these tickets in a View sorted on the Signed date. However, the same business functions also gets follow up requests and direct requests that are not part of the signing process. We have a hard time to build a view that properly balance the request order between these two different processes, because the View only supports a single sort order. Again, dealing with Automations or Triggers to try to build some data based on customer actions and build a view based off on that, makes things quite complicated.Make it simplerWe'd like improved capabilites in Zendesk Support to better determine the order in which our agents process tickets. The current capabilities are that we have two options:Group by (e.g. priority)Sort by (an attribute)These are not enough for us. Due to how SLAs, agent reassignments, customer updates, custom dates from custom processes work, etc, we find ourselves limited in arranging an effective request order pipeline.This becomes even more important if we were to start working with a push model.The situation that we typically find ourselves in is that we find a sort order that works for 80-95% of the tickets, and then we have situations where the simple sort order rules we can have in Views are not enough, and the requests risk a bad customer experience because they are at the end of a view, or somewhere in the middle, when they should be next in line.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

Sydney Neubauer,Side Conversation Limitations,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6245545265946-Side-Conversation-Limitations,10/11/2023,"Overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.].Side Conversations are a fundamental function among our teams. We all use Side Conversations to communicate to third parties (email) and among teams (child tickets) every day and almost on every ticket (we get 9000+tickets a day)Unfortunately, there are more limitations we are experiencing by continuing to use Side Conversations which: slows down our team (time equals money), causes lost communication (possible legal complications), frustration, lost visibility, reduced faith in processes, reduced reliability, and not a good user experienceIntegral core functions that are missing:Change in Assignee/Updater: If you are not part of the child ticket (didn't initiate it) and you do not have access to the group it was started with, you CANNOT continue the conversation. Someone needs to add you to the Child ticket as a CC/Follower (easier said than done as you cannot see the ticket ID that you need to be added to)Visibility: If you are not part of the Child ticket, you cannot see the Status of the child ticket, the Group it is assigned to, or the Ticket ID that is created. Which means that you can't tell when you don't have access to the child ticket vs. when the Child ticket is ClosedPrivate Group Child ticket: There was recently a launch for Private groups which restricts access to Private Groups even if you submitted the request. This also applies to Child tickets. Which means even the requester CANNOT update their own Child ticket that they createdParent ticket follow-up: When a child ticket closes, you cannot update the Child ticket anymore (this is new functionality) to help ensure conversations were not lost as there were no follow ups being created for child tickets. However, this does not apply when the PARENT ticket closes. As such, a child ticket can respond to the parent ticket, but it does not provide any update on the parent ticket. And there is no indication on the child ticket that the conversation is closed (you can click on link but only if you have access to ticket). And there is no follow up ticket created for the parent ticket eitherFeature requests:These suggestions are to just bring Side Conversations up to par with regular ticket interactions.Grids/tables: Ability to use grids/tables within Side Conversations. We have macros that use templates to be filled in for teams, but it cannot be copied, pasted or added via macro.Text editing capabilities: Additional text editing capabilities (colors, formatting, etc.). Same as the current ticket text editorPrint/export Side Conversations: Ability to print/export Side Conversations. Right now, there are no solutions for being able to export a Side Conversation and our teams need to sometimes be able to include a conversation in another ticket as an attachment.Amount of Child tickets: There is a limit of 50 child tickets in one ticket. This prevents the use of certain workflows (communication to agents, bulk notifications, etc.)Signature formatting/Simplified threading: There can be a rather lengthy thread and repeat signatures/previous replies all extend the conversation. Tickets can have a minimize option so it would be nice to include that for Side Conversations to make them easier to read.Internal notes: Side Conversations can get long so you end up needing to read the entire conversation over again (imagine having 5 SC to read and the ticket exchanging assignees).What problem do you see this solving?Core functionality: Right now, it is the expectation that when you talk with other teams, they always get your messages, and that assignee can handle a ticket to 100% of their ability without loss of access. This is not the case so when it happens, it causes backlogs, support tickets, investigations, informing, training, meetings, new workflows, etc. Side Conversations should make our lives easier and not harder.New features: These would bring Side Conversations back up to being on par with ticket functionality (they aren't new features but new to Side Conversations).Goal: A seamless conversation among groups where access and functionality are not lostWhen was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business?I get questions daily about side Conversations and the missing functionality or the behavior limitation.Impact:Change in Assignee/Updater: I currently have 5 tickets about that as the original assignee went on vacation and handed over tickets to other team members. They are unable to update the Child tickets that were started by the original Assignee. I had to create an article, create a reminder communication among the team (not the first time), provide training, add the new assignees as followers, inform managers, etc.Visibility: I get at least one ticket a day asking why they can't update a Child ticket, only to find out the ticket is Closed (even if it wasn't, they couldn't update it due to the access limitation).Private Group Child ticket: We got about 12 tickets when this first rolled out due to the limitation that even requesters could not update their Child tickets for a private group (we only have 3 private groups but are wanting to add more). This resulted in an escalation, a Zendesk ticket for investigation, a review of Private groups and Roles.Parent ticket follow-up: There is a ticket for this a week regarding why a response from a child ticket did not inform the assignee of the parent ticket. A ZD ticket was created for investigation, a review of workflows.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem?Core Features:Change in Assignee/Updater: You have to submit a ticket to IT and then they will add the new Assignee to the Child ticket as a CC/follower to allow them access (this has to be done every time the Assignee changes).Visibility: We had to create a webhook that will add the ticket ID and group it is assigned to as a public comment, so it shows on the Parent ticket for visibility. We are going to need to create another for when status changed to Closed.Private Group Child ticket: We had to request to be excluded from this feature update as you cannot reverse a Group from being a Private group and we did not want to grant all ticket access or group access.Parent ticket follow-up: we are looking into a workflow that will close the child ticket when the parent ticket closes.Feature requests:Grids/tables: The team applies a macro to an internal note with the template, the agent fills in the details and then submits the comment. Then they use another macro to start the Child ticket and they chose the function of copy comments from the parent ticket so it can be included (better hope there are no typos).Text editing capabilities: NonePrint/export Side Conversations: None - we can use API, but this is not widely known or used as it is not typical Agent functionality, only admins.Amount of Child tickets: A new ticket needs to be created to complete the tasks.Signature formatting/Simplified threading: NoneInternal note: To summarize a side conversation, you can add an internal note within the parent ticket but it gets very messy very fast if you have more than one ongoing SC.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function?Core Features:Change in Assignee/Updater: If you have access to the parent ticket, you should be able to access and edit the Child ticket.Visibility: No matter the access of the Agent, they should be able to tell who the Child ticket was created for (Group), the Ticket ID, and the status of the Child ticketPrivate Group Child ticket: It should not matter if it be a Private or a Public Child ticket, it should still be able to be updated if you are accessing it from within a parent ticket.Parent ticket follow-up: Either the parent ticket needs a follow up ticket created for when an update is made from child ticket, or the child ticket needs to close so it can't be edited (it would then mirror the functionality of when a child ticket closes).Feature requests:Grids/tables: A grid/table can be pasted/created/edited within a new side conversation (any type of Side Conversation)Text editing capabilities: Text editor toolbar that is present in tickets is visible and usable within Side ConversationsPrint/export Side Conversations: You can choose to export or print the entire Side Conversation (any type of Side Conversation)Amount of Child tickets: The removal of the limit for how many Side Conversations can be created.Signature formatting/Simplified threading: Just like in current ticket functionality, Agent signatures are added on the backend (tickets add them via triggers), there is simplified threading to reduce the amount of duplicate text shown.Internal note: It functions same as in tickets so you can add an internal note within any of the Side Conversations started (a summary, next steps, etc) so that it is easy for the next Agent to pick up (or help refresh yourself on what to do next).Related feedback posts (thank you everyone!)Ability to update child ticket if you have access to parent ticketTables/GridsPrint Side ConversationsExporting Side ConversationsSide Conversation 50 limitSide Conversation signature formatting",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

One innocuous one is e.g. the 'Turn on emoji text replacement' setting. Other examples include the recent 'Improved views experience' (you can choose whether to limit the visible views or not)... or the contentious 'can we switch the order of replies on tickets' (maybe in the future we can pick between top down or bottom up).The issue here is that when these options are released, they're nearly all at the company-wide level (some are role based). This forces admins to be the decider, immediately making 50% of the company (or role) happy and 50% of them unhappy - because these are all such personal settings. One person wants emoji text replacement on because it makes it easy to pick emojis. Another person hates the feature because they are using code with `:` characters all the time, and it drives them mad. Trying to please everyone is literally impossible.Are there plans to move these types of 'personal experience' setting out from company-wide admin settings, into agent profile configuration/preferences in the future please? Let the agent who prefers to see more views, see more views. Let the agent who prefers to see on the most important shared views, and easily see their personal views, switch it off. Let an agent who prefers text-replacement-emoji, switch that on... etc etc.Thanks for listening team!",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

Currently, there’s no way to link a list with another list and this means having a single secondary list which is very long in order to cover every option in the primary list.In our support process agents have to choose values in 2 form fields that exist in a 2 level space (think ‘category’ and its related ‘close code’). Each item in the primary list has a limited number of related values in the secondary space, and so ideally choosing an item from the primary list will allow agents to choose the secondary from a reduced list, but it isn’t currently possible.It’s a problem for us every day, each time we solve a ticket. This is because each ticket needs to have both form fields filled out but it is currently very easy for agents to submit a wrong combination as there’s no input validation available either.We have a (very poor) workaround in place: duplicating the label from the primary field into the secondary level, thus making the possibility of mismatched categories even worse.The ideal solution would be something like this: for each item in a list, allow an administrator to designate a related list of options that will show in a secondary list when the primary option is chosen.eg:choose A in the first list, options 1,2,3 show up in the 2nd list. choose B in the first list, options 4,5,6 show up in the 2nd list.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

Either saved Drafts or maybe in realtime?Different colored backgrounds to differentiate when a conversation is a public email (white), draft (blue?), internal note (yellow), or chat (green?).IP address and device/browser details are unavailable in Agent Workspace.Have a pop-up on the screen when there is an incoming chat the kind of pop-up that is visible and large in your face and flashing until the chat is accepted whichever screen you are on.The ''apply macro'' section is currently in the far left corner. I would like to see it appear in line with the reply section. In other words, it could be below the reply box.When clicking on the request chat rating button in a chat, it does not automatically close after your request. This can cause you to click on the request chat rating more that once. It would be great if the ''request rating'' box could close automatically as soon as it was sent.Have the ability to have hyperlinking when sending articles to users in the Messaging platform as currently all links are fully displayed when sending either linked help articles or when creating and sending macros.Thank you!The Sendible team!",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

Currently, the SLA breach conditions are handled the same regardless of which target is breached (First Reply Time, Total Resolution Time, etc).Description/Use Cases:We are trying to set up escalations for certain types of tickets based on our SLA Targets. The agent assigned to the ticket will receive a notification when the SLA is breached. If a certain amount of time passes after the breach without a resolution, we want a notification sent to management. If further time passes, we want a notification sent to senior management (see table below).We would like the time between escalation levels to be dependent on the SLA Target. However, the current ""Hours since last SLA breach"" condition in automations does not take into account which SLA target is breached. This means we can only set one time period for each escalation level regardless of which SLA target is breached. In our case, it does not make sense to set one time period to escalate a ticket for First Reply Time, Periodic Update, and Total Resolution Time.Business impact of limitation or missing feature:We can likely use additional automation conditions to work around this limitation for the specific SLA targets we have chosen. However, they will not measure exactly the same way, and they will be harder to maintain. If we decide to change the times on any of the SLA targets (level 1), we would have to update all of the additional automations as well.In addition, we would not be able to work around this at all if we used any of the SLA targets which pause for a particular status. There are not currently automation conditions that align with those targets.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

With this split screen thing we can't see what we typed. If we are in the middle of a ticket and need to refer back to member information we literally have to use the scroll bar ... to see the name ... type that...oh yeah... let me scroll back up again and grab that ID number. Well darn I can't keep too many numbers in my head at one time ... one more trip back to get that date of birth. It took me 45 minutes to do 2 tickets that collectively should have taken less than 15.

We have tried the allow and block list and that didn't work users still need to be verified before a ticket is not suspended. This doesn't work for us when we don't know who could be sending a ticket as anyone in our clients company can summit a ticket to us but doesn't require to log in to our guide to view tickets. Nor do we want our clients to be spammed by our ticketing system because they are not someone that we would likely be dealing with on the regular.We have tried opening our system up to anyone can submit the ticket but then we were heavily spammed by outsiders that have nothing to do with any of our clients which is not ideal. From what zendesk support says there is no way to do what we require.It would be nice if we could have an allow list connected to the suspended ticket setting that states anything coming from one of the listed domains doesn't get suspended and anything else can be.We also use exchange to do some of our filters on our own so it would even be nice if this option could be turned off.If anyone has a work around for this It would be appreciated but ultimately it would be better if zendesk had more setting options for this area.,Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

Having the ability to change, via trigger, the organization based on a ""brand"" condition match would help alleviate manual intervention by agents.Description/Use Cases:Requester is part of 2 organizations (customer service department, division1). They manage the customer service department, however they also perform operational tasks that require the ability to submit tickets regarding division1. They require the ability to view tickets for both organizations. The Requester visits Brand 1 (division1) guide and forgets, or skips over the organization drop down in the web form and the request is submitted with the ""Customer Service Dept"" organization as that is their default. The ticket is now showing under the wrong organization and the fellow divison1 organization members cant see this ticket and submit a duplicate, or a delayed service response as the incorrect SLA was applied.Having a trigger that automatically changes the organization based on the incoming request brand would be helpful to solve the issue of misrouted organization tickets so they are viewable by all of the correct organization members.Business impact of limitation or missing feature:This is important as we have many customers part of multiple organizations because of internal routing, SLA, and ticket visibility.

Alek Reed,Automation Time-Based Conditions,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6114112914202-Automation-Time-Based-Conditions,09/05/2023,"Summary:Additional time-based Automation conditions are needed. The current options are restrictive and do not cover all requirements for Automations.Observed problem:Currently in Automations there are multiple ""hours since"" time contingent conditions including ""hours since assignee update"", ""hours since requester update"", and ""hours since update""; however, there are no options for ""hours since an agent update"", ""hours since an agent public reply"", or ""hours since an end user update"" which are necessary for some use cases.Example use case:Say a team has an operation structure where multiple Agents may respond to a ticket including or in addition to the ticket Assignee. Now say that leadership wishes for tickets to be escalated that have not been responded by any Agent in 24 hours.If an Automation solution was built with the existing option of ""hours since Assignee update"" then it would only be considering the updates of the Assignee, not the updates of peer Agents. Therefore, if another Agent steps in to assist the Requester it would not be recognized by the Automation, and therefore would be escalated.The alternative existing option, ""hours since update"", also has challenges. If this option is used, then any update will ""reset the clock"" of the Automation - including minor updates outside a Public Reply, or, even worse, Requester updates; the reason Requester updates could be considered problematic is that if a Requester becomes agitated on the lack of response and replies ""why haven't you answered me yet?"" it would be recognized as an update and therefore the ticket would not be escalated due to no response, which could compound the issue.This could be solved if we had the ability to either use ""hours since Agent update"" or ""hours since Agent Public Reply"" - the latter being the most useful for this particular use case example.Ideal Solution:Please add additional Automation conditions such as:hours since Agent updatehours since End-User updatehours since Agent Public Replyhours since End User Public Replyhours since Requester Public Reply",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

For example: The assignee of the ticket can always update the child tickets associated with their ticket.Description/Use Cases:We have many teams that work in our instance and they communicate to other teams across divisions (escalations, managers, permissions, entitlements, HR, etc).There may be a legal issue presented in a ticket so they will reach out to HR. However the original assignee goes on vacation so they hand over their current ticket load to another Agent. That Agent needs to be able to continue the conversation with HR without the need of additional steps to do so.Business impact of limitation or missing feature:Right now, if the role of the assignee is tied to only being able to access tickets you are in the group of, and a Child ticket was created for a group that you do not have access to:You CANNOT edit the child ticket from the parent ticketYou CANNOT access the child ticket directlyYou cannot see the status of the child ticket - this is a rather big issue as you cannot update a closed child ticket but it looks the exact same as when you don't have access. So you don't know when it is a permission limitation or the conversation is closedYou cannot see the ticket ID associated with the child ticketYou cannot see which group the child ticket is associated forChild tickets are treated like any other ticket - if you do not have access to the ticket normally, you cannot edit. The idea behind it is so that other users cannot access a potentially private conversation. However, someone that does not have access to update the ticket, can still read the conversation from the parent ticket so it does not make sense as to why they cannot continue the conversation, since assignees change all the time.The workarounds are:Grant them access to the entire group (the purpose of child tickets is so that they only access tickets that are relevant to their assigned ticket)Change their role to have access to all tickets (this would give them way too much access - and they would need to include private groups which defeats the purpose)Have someone on the Child ticket add the new assignee as a follower or change the requester (manual process, creates a bottleneck, loss of efficiency) - but because you cannot see what group the child ticket is for, you aren't even sure who to reach out toIf you have access to the Child ticket, you will be able to see the status of the ticket, group, ID. And you can make updates to the conversation in any status but closedIf you do not have access, you will not be able to see the ticket ID, status, assigned group, and you can't update the ticket regardless of status.

We have a second picklist field called ""Resolution"" that has a long list of resolutions (i.e. 1-20).Since many resolutions are specific to certain categories, the Zendesk admin should be able to set conditions to display certain picklist values based on what is selected in the ""Category"" picklist.For example, if category ""A"" is selected, only resolutions 1 - 5 are selectable. If category ""B"" is selected, only resolutions 5, 6 and 10 are selectable. And so on. Business impact of limitation or missing feature:This is important to reduce the amount of picklist values displayed to an agent, thus reducing the time it takes to select a value out of the displayed options. This is a huge timesaver that will help improve data integrity and streamline reporting.Other necessary information or resources:This is standard functionality in Salesforce and other ticketing systems. There are also several 3rd party apps that have accomplished this in Zendesk, but require a paid subscription:https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/support/861234/hide-dropdown-values-app-by-leafworks/?queryID=2e6b125dfda92ef0b9b0a38b76151801",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

What's especially frustrating is that ZD has a different Facebook integration that you can find with Facebook Page>Include Private messages, which doesn't have any of these issues but misses out on the bot and Sunco features. This makes it seem like they know how to fix these problems and easily could but have de-prioritized it for some reason.Here are some of the problems:- Doesn't record messages sent via meta business suite, which is a shame because the integration is often broken, so we NEED to respond within meta business suite.- Misses a lot of important events in FB conversations that are important for context in the conversation, including... Get Started messages, FAQs, reactions, message bumps. This is such a big problem. Many people just send the get started message and wait for a response, but this never creates a ticket!- Random periods of high latency where it can take minutes to create the initial ticket.- Outages- Weird, unexpected behavior like bot responses saying, ""We cannot connect right now: Start Over,"" despite no bot being connected to the channels.Is anyone else experiencing these issues?

The initial notification is sent from here. Future replies are sent from here. The easiest way to change it is by using the ""Select an Address"" app, but this requires manual user input. You can limit which emails replies are sent from through the app, but if you limit the incoming address Zendesk reverts to the default address, when I want emails to be sent from a particular address.My use case:We set up an email address in our system, tested it, everything seemed good. We advertised the address. Then some issues arose with the address, and the only way out is to change to a new address. The new address is now set as the primary email for that email account, but the To header remains the same through the mail flow, and Zendesk still uses it as the recipient.To headers cannot be modified in transit beyond completely deleting the To header, which means emails addressed to multiple people would lose recipients. A ""recieve and deliver"" forwarding method would destroy customer information.We need to retain the address for incoming emails, but we don't want to use it to send things back out.We can remove the old address as a support address, and the recipient field is set correctly, but if something is directed to the old address, the old address is set as a CC to the email which looks confusing.The current workaround:We're using webhooks to alter the ""recipient"" on arrival. This does have some shortcomings, mainly in extra triggers are required to send notifications, and if the webhook fails no notification email will be sent. We'll just have to monitor all incoming email in the meantime.A permanent fix:Let us set the ""recipient"" field in triggers! This would have allowed the most minor of adjustments to achieve a problem free outcome. Perhaps I am naive to the business or functional reasons this is not already possible, externally it seems like a no brainer. 😅",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

But not everything needs to be a ticket.It would be an absolute game changer for Zendesk, if an email comes into your instance, you can treat it as a regular email. Forward, reply, BCC, etc, receive absence alerts, and create distribution lists. From that inbox, you can choose whether or not to create a ticket. If you wanted the ticket creation you can still set this up using triggers and automation. This way you get the full power of an email platform, and the additional ability of a ticketing system. Best of both worlds. This would open up your platform to so many more customers and can really keep the ticket numbers down for a large enterprise.Does anyone else use this separately now, how do you work them together?

I shouldn't have to create tickets to house these types of data points within a ticket - it generates an unnecessary amount of tickets and data can easily become out of sync between a ticket and the organization field.For example if I change the Customer Health in the Customer Health Ticket, I must also change it in the Organization Field or vise versa.

However, we did encounter one issue where tickets were being assigned to agents in different time zones who were not online. To address this, we quickly developed a script to set all agents to offline. It would have been helpful if this feature was built into the Omnichannel Routing settings. We struggled for about an hour with Zendesk Support before I found documentation from Zendesk suggesting that we either ask all agents to set themselves to offline (which is not feasible for a global company), or use an API call to set all agent statuses to offline.Aside from this issue, we have some feedback that we would like to share to help improve the functionality of Omnichannel Routing.Individual Capacity Rules for AgentsWe have received feedback from agents requesting more personalized capacity rules for ticket management. At times, the default group's capacity rules are too high for them and they would prefer to accept fewer tickets. While we could create a new group for these agents, this would result in an excessive number of groups, rather than managing capacity rules within the capacity rules UI.Buffer Time Before Assigning Tickets to AgentsOur agents are currently receiving a high volume of tickets at once, sometimes up to 5-7 tickets when they set themselves to online. This can be overwhelming for the agent, and they have suggested that there be a buffer in place for ticket distribution to ensure a more equal distribution when another agent comes online. One solution could be to lower the agent's capacity to handle fewer tickets. Another suggestion is to implement a timer that prevents the assignment of new tickets for 5-10 minutes after an agent has been assigned a ticket. This will allow the agent to focus on the current ticket before receiving another one.Waterfall Email TicketsWe have created a Workato recipe that regularly checks all open tickets every 10 minutes. If an agent assigned to a ticket is marked as ""Away"" or ""Offline"" within the last 10 minutes, the ticket is reassigned to the main group assigned by Omnichannel Routing. This is particularly important for tickets received through email, as assigning a ticket to an agent who is away from their computer or at the end of their workday can cause the ticket to go unattended.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

However, when I try to track which articles are resolving the most tickets, I'm unable to do so because the ""End Interaction"" button has the same name for all the interactions after sending and receiving the article.

While Due Date is close to this request, it is not yet specific enough for the Agents.Feature request would be to change Due Date so the Agent can select a specific date and time for the ticket to reopen. For example, instead of just selecting a date in the future, they select the date and thetime they wish for the ticket to reopen.Alternatively, added automation conditions/actions could assist with this. If in an automation one could say ""if X number of (calendar)/(business) hours before due date"" then ""reopen at X time on due date""Understandably automations do not run continuously so an exact minute may be difficult.

We want to send that from our primary support email (support@mydomain.org) so that any replies will be delivered to Zendesk. But we'd also like to copy zendesk with a CC copy of that original email so that we have a ticket in Zendesk to track the communication, particularly so that we can follow up if we get no response).Unfortunately, at the moment, because that initial email has a reply address of the primary support address, the ticket is suspended. This means that today we simply do not include support@mydomain.com as a cc address; if the user replies, we get a ticket, but we need to track this communication separately to cover the case that the user does NOT reply and needs followup. And of course having separate systems to track follow-ups is less than ideal!My proposal - if the domain of the support address is included on the white-list of allowed domains and addresses, this would override the suspension of messages from the support address. Or perhaps we could be a bit more specific, if the individual email for the support address is in the white-list, this bypasses the suspension.Less desirable alternative: if there was some keyword that we could place into the message that would tell the code determining whether to suspend the ticket that this was intentional, then that could be the trigger for the override. Something like ""action:create_zendesk_ticket"" would virtually never occur naturally in a message (avoiding false positives); if we embedded it by hand in our email signature, it wouldn't be too obtrusive to the recipient of the email.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

We currently have a way to view all tags across all tickets, or see all tickets with a specific tag, but those really aren't enough.GOAL: Allow Agents to view a comprehensive list of all tags that exists on existing tickets, what tags Triggers and Automations interact with, as well as which tags are linked to Custom Ticket Fields. To allow Agents to group tags and define special behaviors/rules that apply to those tags. To allow Agents to refer to an entire group of Tags when using Trigger or Automation conditionals. To allow Agent to link a specific tag to a piece of Information/Data, using them to fill a placeholder.PROPOSED FEATURES:List all tags across all existing Tickets, Triggers, Automations & Custom Ticket FieldsThe ability to see which Triggers or Automations are interacting with a specific tag or tag group and the type of interaction. (Condition or Action)The ability to Group Tags and define special rules at the Group level. Groups don't need to contain more than one Tag.Tag Groups can be used in Trigger & Automation Conditionals & Actions.Use Case: If a tag group is referenced in a Contains none of the following Trigger conditional, then Agents would be able to update the Tag Group directly instead of needing to edit each individual trigger. Allowing for greater flexibility in logic design for Triggers & Automations. Pairs with Tag Linked Information.Example Group Rule: Mutual Exclusivity. Make it so that tags in a specific group cannot be applied to the same ticket at the same time. Streamlines logic and pairs well with Tag Linked Information.Example Group Rule: Non-Inheritable. Make it so all tags in a specific group cannot be inherited by Follow-Up tickets. Allows simplified control over which tags are carried forward to a new ticket.Tag Linked Information: Allow Agents to link specific pieces of information to a tag. Everything from Comment Text, to Agents, to Groups and More. Allow a single tag to be linked to a single Agent, single Group, or a specific Agent & Group combination.Use Case: Trigger Action to assign a ticket references a mutually exclusive Tag Group. All tags in group are linked to a different Agent. Action reads tag group and assigns the ticket to the Agent which matches a tag on the ticket. This also works with Groups. Good for handling automatic escalation or sorting via triggers.Use Case: Macro or Trigger is used to create a public ticket comment. Macro/Trigger can reference Tags on ticket to fetch information to be used within comment placeholder. Enables a larger number of Macros/Triggers to reference the same information without needing to add that information into each Macro/Trigger. Simplifies updates to such information by centralizing where it is stored.Use Case: A new action option could check who a ticket is currently assigned to and assign the corresponding Tag from a selected Tag Group.Obviously this would be a major feature. Implementing an entire new UI like this would be a large project, but I believe this would be a massive improvement for Zendesk Support. It would significantly improve the flexibility of all forms of automation within the system. Allow for more flexible and thus more streamlined Triggers.Expanding upon one of the mentioned use cases above, imagine a trigger that handles de-escalating a ticket back to the lower tier Agent who previously had it. All they need to do is update a custom ticket field to De-Escalate the ticket, and the trigger will handle returning the ticket to the original agent. We are currently using such a system, but we have a different trigger for every Group and a separate set for each Agent. Together these two sets of triggers are able to return a de-escalated ticket back to the original Agent & Group. The Group part is important as some agents exist in multiple groups.With Tag Groups and Tag Linked Information, I could reduce that to a single trigger.",Feedback - Ticketing System (Support)

This message can pop up as the user is typing and/or an auto-reply message - preferably the popup. This might be useful for staff and customers. (my two cents anyway)Both directions:Agents are made aware when the Customer is OOO:Have the agent get notified when a requester is OOO..or even better, as they are typing the message as Outlook does. Example: Sometimes, I will keep checking with someone that does not reply to a ticket only to find out they have been OOO.Customers are made aware when the assigned Agent is OOO: Have the end user get the passthrough message for the agent OOO message so the customer knows then the agent is OOO.

Especially with partners that have large volumes of work to do on their side.This is making it harder for agents to then understand threads when having to open multiple follow ups.The easiest/most affective way to change this would be to have the option to set a specific period of days before you wish for your ticket to be in a closed state.

If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box.

However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics.

If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen.

We want to restrict Agents/Admins, phone numbers, settings, Chat CSAT, email template, contextual workspaces, layout builder, triggers, automations, macros, dynamic content, etc. This would impact everyone in Zendesk as well as the business as a whole as there are teams that can handle their own BrandWhat problem do you see this solving?Right now it is an all or nothing approach to a lot of features which means that it solely falls on Admins and it is a setting that impacts the entire instance.When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business?We are impacted everyday as there is always something an Admin needs to do and when they do it, they have to implement it for everyone.ie. We add phone numbers daily to ZD, which just keeps adding to the list of phone numbers listed in the Talk Console. Agents use the wrong numbers all the time and there are deletion restrictions set up on some so recordings get deleted when they shouldn't just because they used the wrong number (for a group they don't have access to)ie. We can't turn on Chat CSAT as it is a system wide setting and one Brand cannot have it on. As such, we need to look into a separate instance just to turn on Chat CSAT for Brand as it is a business requirementie. We have Managers that want to be admins to handle just their Brand items (triggers, automations) but that would mean they can access HR/IT tickets as well as their setup, so it falls to the system wide Admins and gets bottleneckedie. We want to roll out contextual workspaces but anyone can create or edit workspaces. As such, it would be too much monitoring/training to ensure that they don't make a workspace for team they aren't part of OR edit a workspace that does not belong to them.ie. We have to coordinate among all Brands to get a unified sense of Branding. If they don't then we need to find common ground/custom coding. It is so much work and as such, there are changes we have made where a team had to get a developer involved to create custom code to keep the previous branding.ie. Macro permissions are you either can have group editing or all editing. As such, each group associated with the Brand needs to be added to the macro. If that is too much work, they have to request someone with all macro access to create the macro and specify it is only for a certain Brand which produces the chance that another Brand uses it.ie. We have triggers that are setup per Brand. Either you have all access or you don't. So we had an instance where a manager was an admin so they edited triggers that impacted other Brands without proper process for the other teams and it caused an escalation.ie. When we get a spam caller, we block the number but it may be spam for one Brand but not another. It needs to be agreed upon that this caller cannot contact any BrandAre you currently using a workaround to solve this problem?Yes - We are restricting Admins and having workflows where tickets need to be submitted, reviewed by an admin and put in backlog (too many requests)Yes - We have to set up regular meetings to talk about changes that will impact everyone and then wait for approval for each Brand. Which can take months.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function?Admins: Ability to set Admins to be in charge of certain Brands - so they can't make any edits to features that are outside of their Brands. Anything outside their Brand can be chosento what they can see (read-only vrs no access). Ability to set if they can access tickets outside their Brand (read-only, ability to edit or only able to search but not open, or see only ticket events and not comments) - helps with troubleshooting.There are Admins dedicated to all system settings (role creation/editing, group creation/deletion, onboarding/offboarding/email template updates etc) so we would want more granular sub permissions for Brand Admins to ensure they can't do certain tasks.Brand based settings/visibility: Every setting that is system wide should be able to be set per Brand, or an option that states ""apply to all brands"" so that you don't need to duplicate the work/effortWhen you perform rule analysis, you can see Brand based settings (states it impacts all, or just this Brand)You can set Triggers/SLAs/Dynamic Content/Views/Macros etc to be tied specificallyto Brands so it is easier to search/filter and can be implemented without impacting everyone in the instance (Instances within instances)RelatedRestricting tickets visibility to Brand – Zendesk helphttps://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6224169063066-Talk-Admin-Centre-UI-overhaulFeature request: Contextual workspace for – Zendesk helphttps://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/4408868196890-Feature-Request-Additional-Contextual-Workspace-options",Feedback - Admin Center

When managing organizations with many Custom Roles, the only way to get a view of all Licensed agents is to use the Filters to select each role individually, which is clunky, and requires exact knowledge of which roles consume licenses or are forms of Light Agent.There doesn't appear to be any way to sort or filter for Suspension Status currently either.Finally, it would be useful to be able to manage (or at least View/Sort) Agent Groups and Tags.

On the other hand, these permissions are configurable for other licenses.I understand that there are serious limitations to access governance with regard to custom objects (ie macro bypass of permissions on other roles), and I assume that is inherent to the architecture. However, since other roles can have their access configured, it seems like this restriction on modifications is arbitrary.Custom objects could include sensitive data relevant to work done by private groups and should not be accessible to our light agents, contributors, or other members not in the private group.

As we're definitely not the first to try and accomplish this goal (as per the existence of these articles), a native A/B testing solution in Zendesk would be amazing.Boiled down to the simplest requirement, all that's really needed to make this feasible is a trigger or rule that causes all incoming tickets to be tagged as A or B (or A/B/C, A/B/C/D, depending on the test) and alternate between them / rotate through the list.

As our Company grows, the Talk Admin Centre becomes more and more unnavigable. This increases human error, increases resolution time, decreases productivity. There are many changes that can be made to help increase quality of life (outlined below)Admins are the ones that interact with the Talk admin center but when it is a request from the business, they get impacted when we can't give them updates/answers right away. In the end, this impacts everyone in one way or another. And it impacts the product if our experience is less than perfect as a lot of the changes/information rely on manual effortWhat problem do you see this solving?Easier updates, quicker turnaround times, less frustration, additional workflow options, easier training, decreased impact when errors occur, decreased chance for human error, better organizationWhen was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business?Impacted every single day as we do daily onboardings, greeting updates (holidays, outage, re-branding, etc)When we troubleshoot phone number routing and when greetings are incorrect, we need to navigate to the Talk admin centre. The loading issues are a major issue. And not being able to search for the impacted number requires navigating 24 separate pages to locate the number (the pages are going to continue going up and not down)WorkaroundsThere are no solutions we have found to make it easier to navigate or load fasterThe API isn't the best experience for us as it requires having the details in order to make any updates. We have 20+ admins that all make Talk changes, it would be unsustainable to keep a record. So we would have to make an API call to get an updated list every time we needed to make an update (many different API calls to get greetings, phone numbers, IVR setup, etc). Not to mention, make the information readable and processable into a format to make the necessary updates (this does not address the issue of being able to listen to the greetings to see if it is a mis-spelling of a greeting and then the wrong one was added to a number)What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function?Decrease loading times. Currently there are extreme loading delays. (10 seconds when flipping pages, 36 seconds to load greetings, 24 seconds when you click into a number to edit)Talk settings split up by Brand/Group rather than by instance wide (queue size, queue wait time, etc) as our teams have different needs and they don't align.Able to search for number, brand, unassigned numbers, nickname, groupAble to group numbers together for organization and easier navigation (like trigger categories)Ability to group greetings together for easier navigation (I would like to see all of the greetings associated with a certain group or brand)Ability to compare number setup without needing to scroll to find or duplicate tabs to compare (IVR comparison, Number settings - greeting comparison, etc)Transcript for greetings to allow us to read what each greeting is about without the need to listen to each greetingAbility to add notes/descriptions to greetings/numbers for future admins touching the setupAble to have holiday greetings. Right now we have to manually go in and change greetings for each number before a holiday begins (human error), and then go back to change it back (human error)Able to see revision history (ability to revert those changes ie. When a greeting is overwritten by accident)Ability to download greetings - there is a bug for windows and can only be downloaded via firefoxA better UI for greetingsAssign greetings to Brandsmake it searchable (so you can see all greetings with a certain name on a single page (rather than scrolling and ctrl+f)Ability to play greetings from inside the phone number settings (you can play it inside the VM greeting)Ability to search for greetings assigned to a numberEasy way to copy ZD phone number without needing to open/close the number (especially when you have it open and need to copy the number which makes it close and then you need to wait for it to reload again)A better method to see a list of groups in IVR and then clone the selectionsAbility to see when a greeting was updated/changedAbility to set an outage greeting and what behavior is to occur after it is played (easy to enable and disable, ability to continue routing or go to VM). This is important as it is only temporary to have it set up so it is a waste of time to manually change this to the outage greeting and then back. This is similar to the holiday greeting but we have a heads up with holidays. Outages are much more time sensitive and require faster responses. I had to do this yesterday for 15 phone numbers. And it took 5 hours (documentation of previous setup, loading time, upload new greetings, change greeting, turn off ivr so all calls go to VM, adjust triggers for routing)For routing tab inside editing a number, when there is group set up for routing, have the groups enabled for this number show at the top so we don't have to scroll to see which groups are enabled (could be one, could be many - there is human error if you miss one of the groups this number routes to)Within the ZD phone number editing page, you are unable to search for greetings when trying to apply them. Which means you have to scroll for the greetings (they are alphabetical but if you do not know the exact wording, you will have a tough time scrolling). So, it would be beneficial to be able to type and search for greetings when trying to apply them (like trigger conditions)Able to see what numbers are going to which group at first glance on a single page.Have the web URL reflect what page you were on (does not change when you are on page 24 vs. greetings). This would help documentation purposes and bookmarks for quick links.A way to demo the phone number set up without leaving the Talk Admin Centre (IVR routing, listening to the flow of greetings - similar to Chat in the settings page). The issue we run into is that to test the workflow, we would need Agents online/offline to ensure the setup is correct, and it results in a ticket being created. Especially if you need to test many IVR selections (imagine calling a number 10 times to listen to each IVR selection)",Feedback - Admin Center

It would be prevent downstream errors and reduce admin work time if filter criteria on triggers page could include 'unavailable'.Current: Without comprehensive knowledge of triggers and automations, this means that admin changes could mean a condition is no longer possible, rendering the rules less effective. In order to find unavailable trigger conditions, you need to open each individual trigger to review for errors. Applying filters can help narrow down the triggers affected by a known change, but without the granularity needed.Use cases:When a field or other asset is disabled/deleted, the condition/action is no longer available, but no errors are thrown. This means that there are downstream effects that may not be apparent, especially ones that don't have agent eyes on the expected behavior.Recently spun up a new sandbox so we could test a workflow involving 3 support emails. New sandboxes don't carry over the support emails from the email channel settings, and the email gets changed to a new subdomain - this means that the emails we'll be testing need to be recreated with the new subdomain. We have 51 triggers that include 'received at' conditions - the existing filter options can narrow it down from our 129 triggers to just the 51, but without knowing which ones rely on the 3 support emails, the admin needs to go through all 51 or cross-reference against live to identify which ones are impacted and need to be updated.Desired: Include 'unavailable' as an option in the filter drop downs so that admin can quickly identify conditions and actions that are no longer possible.",Feedback - Admin Center

Shawna James,Product feedback guidelines & how to write a good feedback post,https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/6207882704538-Product-feedback-guidelines-how-to-write-a-good-feedback-post,09/29/2023,"Welcome to the Product Feedback Topic for Zendesk's Mobile Apps!No one knows our products better than you, our users. We love hearing about how you use our tools and what would make them better. This guide is here to help you understand how the product feedback process works, and how to write an effective feedback post. You may also want to check out this short video on giving product feedback at Zendesk.This topic is for product feedback about the ticketing system. Don't worry, if your post should be in another topic, the Zendesk Community Team will move your post to the correct topic.Here are a few guidelines on how to use the Product Feedback topic, so that our Product team can effectively use and apply your feedback to our product planning process:Follow the Community Code of ConductFeedback and constructive criticism are welcome. Disparaging, harassing, mean, or snarky remarks about Zendesk, its employees, vendors, partners, or other community members will not be tolerated. We’re all friends and professionals, so let’s keep it polite. We don’t like having to remove comments, but we reserve the right to do so without warning in order to maintain a positive community experience for everyone.If it's a bug, contact supportThis topic is for sharing ideas about the product. If you're reporting an actual bug, you should contact Zendesk Customer Support so they can assist further.SEARCH before you postWe receive hundreds of feedback posts every month, so there's a good chance someone has already made a suggestion similar to yours. Keeping conversations in existing threads makes them easier for others to find, and helps keep the Community organized. Here's how to filter your search:Vote for suggestions you likeVotes do matter! See a post or comment you like or agree with? Use that up arrow! Feel like making a post that just says ""+1""? Please use the upvote button instead. Post a comment to share your detailed use case.Use the template: Give details, examples, and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solveOur Product Managers are problem solvers! The most helpful Product Feedback posts are the ones that describe the nature and scope of a problem. Please use the template that is auto populated in the description box. Crafted with our PM’s, this template is meant to address the essential questions and provide the most comprehensible information available. Try to share the following information in your post or comment:Feature Request SummaryUse CaseProduct limitation or missing featureBusiness impact of limitation or missing featureOther necessary information or resourcesHere is a template for feature requests that will auto populate when you create a new post with product feedback.It's much easier for us to address a suggestion if we clearly understand the context of the issue, the problem, and why it matters to you.Rest assured we will read your post, but we may not respondOnce you post in our community, your feedback will be logged and acknowledged by a product feedback specialist to let you know it has been received.Our Product Managers dedicate time each week in the community to read your comments, answer your questions, ask you questions about your feedback, and lead conversations around areas they’re focused on.That said, we simply can't respond to everything. (Remember what we said about hundreds of post per month? ...yeah. There just aren’t enough hours in the day!)Zendesk team members may engage in conversations, ask follow-up questions, or even start threads on topics they’re exploring. If your post or comment doesn’t receive a response, don’t worry. We’ve seen it, and we’ll let you know if and when we have any updates to share.Posts are not guaranteed a response, or inclusion in any product backlogs or roadmaps. This forum is simply for sharing your challenges and how you use the product, but it is not a case/resolution system.Our product teams have also committed to providing updates each quarter following their regular roadmap planning meetings. We’ll let you know what we’re incorporating into our roadmap, and what we aren’t.We don’t share timelinesOccasionally, we’ll share very general ideas of what is or isn’t on a roadmap, or roughly when you might expect to see something roll out. However, we do not share specific dates. Any timelines we share are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.There are situations where we aren't ready to share what we're up to or it's not reasonable for us to give specifics. While we are as up front as we can be, our roadmap is full of projects and we generally don’t provide timelines for new features or changes. If we do provide a timeline, know that it is subject to change.Post maintenance and archivingRequests that have been inactive (have not received a new comment) for 6+ months will be archived. These are retained internally and remain visible to product managers. This helps to keep the community navigable and helps us prioritize the requests that are most important to the largest number of users.This doesn't mean your idea was bad, or that it will never happen. It just means that it wasn't something that came up for a lot of users. Since we keep records, if the idea pops up again, we’ll aggregate those ideas behind the scenes and know when something keeps coming up.This also means that if there's an idea you like, be sure to stay active in that conversation!Comments that turn disparaging, mean, or are otherwise unhelpful to the conversation may be removed without warning. You're allowed to express frustration or dissatisfaction, just remember there are real people on the other side of the screen. Your boss and your neighbor can see these comments if they Google your name. So keep it civil and professional.Thank you for reading this and for understanding how we address suggestions. We value all feedback and we're happy to have a place to engage in these conversations.",Feedback - Mobile Apps

This format is meant to help our PM’s get the most information from you to better understand and log your requests. This format will be rolled out at the end of 2023 and will be enforced as a requirement for all new posts to be logged and/or responded to by product managers.Example:TITLE: Pizza Order ButtonPlease give a quick overview of your product feature request or feedback and note who in your org is affected by this issue [ex. agents, admins, customers, etc.]. (2-3 sentences)I would like to be able to order a pizza from my favorite restaurant directly by opening a Z2 ticket. This feature is currently affecting my agents because they are hungry and my customers because they are dealing with hungry and grumpy agents.What problem do you see this solving? (1-2 sentences)Agent team is working late and they are hungry, but the ticket queue is too high for any of them to leave and get pizza. This button would allow for a quick click, confirmation, and order without having to leave your desk. Customizable order templates for each employee would also be amazing!When was the last time you were affected by this lack of functionality, or specific tool? What happened? How often does this problem occur and how does this impact your business? (3-4 sentences)This problem happens on a daily basis. This is critical for our business as our agents get very hungry which affects their productivity and our customer satisfaction score.Are you currently using a workaround to solve this problem? (If yes, please explain) (1-2 sentences)Yes, my agents have to manually order pizza on their phones using a third party app.What would be your ideal solution to this problem? How would it work or function? (1-2 sentences)I would like to see an option to order pizza in the upper right hand corner of my screen, represented by a pizza emoji which, when I click it, will take me directly to an order form for my nearest pizza shop. It would be great if the system could remember my previous order and use that data to speed up the ordering process.",Feedback - Mobile Apps
